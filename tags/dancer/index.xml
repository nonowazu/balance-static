&lt;h1 id="foreword">FOREWORD&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>One of the biggest requests I have had is a more concise document on what people “need to know” before jumping into more difficult content. This is not meant to be a replacement for a general guide to Dancer; please see Ringabel’s extensive write-up instead, which will be linked at the end of the document in the appendix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This guide will be broken down into three sections: Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced. I am hopeful that even some of the more experienced players may learn something new from this document.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dancer FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 04:00:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/faq/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="dance-partner-priority">DANCE PARTNER PRIORITY&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This list is made in a gear/skill vacuum. This is the recommended partner priority list.&lt;br>
Special Note: some fights may favor certain Dance Partners over others based on phases/mechanics or ability to hit multiple targets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Updated: January 19, 2021 to account for balance changes in patch 5.4.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;li>SAM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NIN&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MNK / BLM (crit build)*&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DRG / SMN&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RDM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MCH&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BRD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DNC&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>*Data on BLM SpS build as a dance partner is not available due to length in time to reach BiS with this build as of this update, but value as a dance partner is believed to drop significantly between the two builds due to under utilization of Devilment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dancer Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:56:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
