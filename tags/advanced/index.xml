&lt;h1 id="foreword">FOREWORD&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>One of the biggest requests I have had is a more concise document on what people “need to know” before jumping into more difficult content. This is not meant to be a replacement for a general guide to Dancer; please see Ringabel’s extensive write-up instead, which will be linked at the end of the document in the appendix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This guide will be broken down into three sections: Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced. I am hopeful that even some of the more experienced players may learn something new from this document.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reaper Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 02:44:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/advanced-guide/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="this-guide-will-be-updated-for-dawntrail-at-a-later-date">This guide will be updated for Dawntrail at a later date.&lt;/h2></description></item><item><title>Reaper Non-Standard Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/non-standard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 22:45:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/non-standard/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="placeholder">Placeholder&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This guide will cover some Endwalker Red Mage optimization concepts and principles that aren’t fully covered in the basic job guide. The intended audience includes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Red Mage players who have the fundamentals mostly down and are familiar with all the concepts in the &lt;a href="https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/basic-guide/">basic job guide&lt;/a>, but are trying to improve.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>High performing Red Mage players who get good logs through good GCD uptime, intuitive sense and repetition but wish to augment their theoretical understanding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Players who have experience optimizing other jobs but are trying out Red Mage.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Some of the content here will cover concepts that are obvious to people who have experience playing other jobs at a high level. Other aspects will be unique to Red Mage.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
