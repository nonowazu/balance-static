For weapons: item level (ilvl)/weapon damage (wd) wins, regardless of substats. For armor: ilvl usually wins, unless 5 materia slots. For same-ilvl pieces: substat itemization can be in your favor or not depending on the rest of your gear and stat tiering.

Whether you’re a fresh level 100, a returning player, or just need a refresher, this guide will get you started and help you feel comfortable.
This is a basic introduction to level 100 Bard. It will not go into many nuances, optimizations, or topics outside of playing the job in battle. In particular, this will not cover a range of nuances that aim to keep key skills on cooldown despite Bard&amp;rsquo;s shifting speeds.</description></item><item><title>Monk Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:59:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Know Your Role Melee DPS jobs have a unique mechanic in positionals. Certain actions will deal more damage when executed from the rear or flank of a target. Targets with continuous Target Rings will always take the increased damage from positional actions. The Role Action True North allows you to disregard positional requirements for ten seconds per use.
While it is a loss to miss your Positionals, landing them should be your last priority, after you have met all of the other combat priority requirements of a melee DPS job.</description></item><item><title>Bard Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 02:39:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Bard Leveling Guide Gear Always use the gear with the highest dexterity available to you. This is more important than any secondary stat - you should not worry about those until endgame.
Aside from some early quest rewards and vendor gear bought for gil, a piece&amp;rsquo;s item level correlates to its Dexterity. So you can just use the highest item level gear and you&amp;rsquo;ll be good to go.
Bards use &amp;ldquo;Aiming&amp;rdquo; gear, so if you see that label on a coffer quest reward, that one is for you.</description></item><item><title>Bard Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 02:09:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/openers/</guid><description>Bard Openers There are a few other openers you will see around, but the two below are the main general-purpose intermediate options.
For all openers:
Any given Burst Shot in the image could be Refulgent Arrow, or vice versa save for the one using Barrage. Use Pitch Perfect at three stacks as able, Heartbreak Shot as able, and Refulgent procs as you get them.

This will cover enough ground to get you started with AST, being able to handle this relatively high-input job in content at level 90. It is intended to be well-suited for any player, and if you take the advice and techniques from this guide you should be able to handle yourself well-enough in endgame content.
As this guide is relatively basic and does not go into any of the complexities of Astrologian, there will, of course, be gaps of knowledge, and some aspects of this fairly high-intensity job will be glossed over.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 04:26:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Best-in-Slot (BiS) For your Best-in-Slot gear, you will generally be going for Weapon Damage&amp;gt; Dexterity&amp;gt; Crit&amp;gt; Direct Hit&amp;gt; Determination &amp;raquo; Skill Speed.

Job Overview Black Mage is a caster specializing in high, steady personal damage in place of providing party buffs. The job maintains a cyclical flow of expending MP via long, powerful casts in Astral Fire then swapping to refresh MP in Umbral Ice. While the rotation itself is somewhat simple, utilizing its movement tools and the flexibility built into its rotation to their fullest is key to maintaining uptime and maximizing damage as a Black Mage.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 08:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Red Mage Leveling Guide Updated for 7.0 Introduction The purpose of this guide is to help players understand the core mechanics of Red Mage.

Intro Gunbreaker is a tank job with a focus on continuously building and spending cartridges to deal very high damage inside of strict burst windows. As a basic overview, the rotation is a builder-spender rotation focused on optimizing damage dealt every minute inside No Mercy, which is a 20% damage buff that lasts for 20 seconds after its use.</description></item><item><title>Gunbreaker Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 18:56:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Leveling Guide Like any other class, you may have to do lower level content and of course will need to Level from level 60 to level 90 if forgoing a jump book. So, it’s important to keep on top of GNB, especially at Level 70 due to sync for The Weapon’s Refrain (Ultimate) and The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate).
No Mercy is unlocked at level 2, so it’s used in all forms of content from the beginning of A Realm Reborn up to current content in Endwalker.</description></item><item><title>Dancer Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 14:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/skills-overview/</guid><description>Actions Icon Action Level Type Casting Recast Description Cascade 1 Weaponskill Instant 2.5s Delivers an attack with a potency of 220.

P﻿lease note that this guide is intended for Viper at Level 100. For information prior to reaching Level 100, please visit the Leveling Guide.
1﻿.1 Overview Viper (VPR) is a fast-paced melee DPS that alternates between fast dual wield attacks and heavy hitting twinblade attacks. Its core gameplay revolves around the classic builder-spender playstyle, building gauge with its dual wield and twinblade attacks and spending that gauge on a powerful burst window called Reawaken.</description></item><item><title>Viper Standard Opener</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/viper/openers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 19:33:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/viper/openers/</guid><description> Click here for a larger image.

However, it is recommended to use the highest item level gear available to you, as it will give you more of your primary stat which will always result in a higher DPS gain than lower item level counterparts.
When melding with materia, it is advised to follow the same stat priority.</description></item><item><title>White Mage Opener</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:05:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/openers/</guid><description>Standard Opener In most cases, use this

As healers do not have a strict healing rotation, this guide will focus on highlighting what makes each skill unique and explain some common use cases.
White Mage is considered by many people to be the most beginner friendly healer, and rightfully so.</description></item><item><title>White Mage Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 19:15:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/stat-priority/</guid><description>In general this will boil down to choosing max item level gear with sufficient Piety while maximizing Crit, then melding Crit &amp;gt; DH/DET where possible, though Piety melds can be useful in a pinch if you end up too low.
Piety is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower iLvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don&amp;rsquo;t actively use lower iLvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself).</description></item><item><title>White Mage Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 19:12:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Gear and Job Quests Keep up to date with job quests; job quests will give you solid spells or vital gear.

The increase of Strength and survivability outweighs potentially more favorable substats in lower Item Level gear. The total amount of substats is also higher.
Dragoons use Maiming armor and Slaying accessories. Low level gear may not be labeled as such, so make sure you always equip gear that gives a bonus to Strength.

As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin Snakes and True.
What&amp;rsquo;s with the double Dragon Kick in the openers?
With Standard, you DK after Perfect Balance for DK&amp;rsquo;s higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally. With Early Buff a stanceless Leaden Boot after PB is worse on average than using the DK to guarantee a crit one.

The choice between demo opener and dk opener will likely depend on your group’s buff timings or fight phasing: choose dk opener as the default.

A couple of GCDs into Minuet. This is to cover as much Pitch Perfect potential as possible.
When do I use my second/third potion?
Try to cover Raging Strikes and Barrage with it. That damage spike is bigger than any heap of party buffs. If you can, also try to pop it right before an Iron Jaws, so that you can IJ at the end and get two runs of buffed DoTs.</description></item><item><title>Bard Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 21:31:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/skills-overview/</guid><description>Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find notes and clarifications about Bard&amp;rsquo;s skills.

Red Mage is somewhat flexible with its openers: Often, prioritizing one thing comes at the expense of another (i.e. buff damage potency vs Fleche/Contre Sixte usage vs movement flexibility for mechanics), and what is actually optimal or most practical will depend on encounter design. If further discoveries are made or job changes occur, these openers will be adjusted for future versions of the guide, and readers can also expect fight-specific Savage and/or Ultimate openers to be made for encounters with more unique timelines.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/faq/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 11:18:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions Type !faq drg in #bot_spam for a full list of commands to answer other common questions!
How does Raiden Thrust work?
Raiden Thrust is an upgraded True Thrust. It combos into both Disembowel and Vorpal Thrust and replaces True Thrust on your bar when it’s ready. You activate it by successfully landing the positional on the fifth hit of your combo (Fang and Claw or Wheeling Thrust following Wheeling Thrust or Fang and Claw, respectively).</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 11:16:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dragoon Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/openers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 11:14:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/openers/</guid><description>Dragoon Opener and Rotation The primary use of the Opener is to prepare your cooldown alignment for the rest of the encounter.

If you need to use a heal in the opener or hold an AF stack for later healing do so. This is the ability usage you&amp;rsquo;d do on a dummy, but not every fight allows for it.
Dissipation First Openers: You can swap the place of Aetherflow and Dissipation in both of the above openers. This can have several advantages: the fairy comes back about 15s earlier due to an earlier Dissipation (giving you access to her healing again), the 2000mp from Aetherflow comes later (meaning it won&amp;rsquo;t be wasted to overcapping), and it aligns Aetherflow correctly for a six ED buff window at two minutes.</description></item><item><title>Scholar Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 20:34:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/skills-overview/</guid><description>Notable Dawntrail Changes New skills: Baneful Impaction and Seraphism Swiftcast cooldown reduced to 40s with a trait.

Use Searing Light in alignment with party raid buffs Summon Solar Bahamut and use all abilities to refresh your primal gems Go through three primal phases Summon Bahamut or Phoenix and use all abilities to refresh your primal gems Go through three primal phases Repeat Within that framework, there is additional nuance such as optimizing damage into raid buffs, moving certain spells around based on movement requirements, and making effective use of Summoner&amp;rsquo;s various utility tools.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 05:19:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Paladin Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 05:09:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Paladin Best in Slot Gear Priority and Pre-BiS Day one prog set(s) will be listed immediately when a new tier is released, but pre-BiS will otherwise not be maintained on this page.

Circle of Scorn is used before Fight or Flight in most openers and kept on cooldown in most phases for two reasons:
Its short cooldown (25 seconds) is equal to the duration of Fight or Flight, meaning one CoS usage should always occur during FoF regardless of their respective timings, given full uptime. Its high DoT uptime (~60%) means that any delays are likely to cost ticks at the end of the phase, resulting in a potency loss overall.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 05:01:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</guid><description>Paladin Openers Tanks currently use Grade 1 Gemdraught of Strength (Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing).
Opener Burst Use Fight or Flight on cooldown, this begins your burst phase. At 2.50 GCD and following the standard opener, double weave Imperator after Fight or Flight (see FAQ for bursting at other speeds) Similar to the opener, use your high potency skills (Confiteor + Blades, Goring Blade) and oGCDs (Circle of Scorn, Expiacion, Intervene, Blade of Honor) as they become available For the remaining duration of Fight or Flight, prioritize your high potency filler GCDs (Royal Authority, Atonement/Supplication/Sepulchre, Holy Spirit with Divine Might buff) Since Sepulchre is stronger than Holy Spirit with Divine Might (which is stronger than Royal Authority, Atonement, and Supplication), prioritize putting Sepulchre in Fight or Flight if able (this will not be possible if Royal Authority falls inside Fight or Flight).</description></item><item><title>Paladin Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 02:27:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</guid><description>Buffs Iron Will Toggle | 3s cooldown after toggling on. | 1s cooldown after toggling off.

SpS to 2.46-2.48 &amp;gt; Crit &amp;gt; Det &amp;gt;= DH &amp;gt; More SpS
Previously, SpS was more viable due to the the general potencies being a negligible gain or loss whether the demi phase drifted outside of buffs, but with the addition of Solar Bahamut at Lv. 100, it&amp;rsquo;s now more important to align with with raid buffs. SpS is also weaker at the beginning of the expansion, as a suitable amount of SpS to make the build remotely viable isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to get natively.</description></item><item><title>Machinist Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 12:37:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Reaper Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/openers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 23:32:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/openers/</guid><description>2nd GCD AC Full Size

This is the second part of our basic combo.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 00:33:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</guid><description>⦿ Late weave Trick Attack as much as possible without clipping. ⦿ Mug should be held a GCD after the opener (at next usage) then used strictly on cooldown after.
⦿ It is important to start preparing the Suiton prepull at -6 seconds on the countdown and use at -1 second. This will not pull the boss early and allows future mudras to come off cooldown sooner.
⦿ This version uses Trick Attack at the 4th GCD instead of the standard 3rd.</description></item><item><title>Monk Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 00:32:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/skills-overview/</guid><description>Single Target GCDs Monk has six core single-target GCDs:

Q: Are there any Shukuchi macros?
A: Yes, the main ones use either to go to your target at the time, or use &amp;lt;1&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;2&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;3&amp;gt;, etc to go to specific party members.
Q: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
A: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority.</description></item><item><title>Gunbreaker Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 04:30:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/skills-overview/</guid><description>Gunbreaker Skills Overview Offensive On Global Cool Down Abilities Keen Edge Deals 300 potency to a single target.

As such, we can modify our openers quite easily in order to better suit our needs.
Early Openers An early opener is exactly what it sounds like. By skipping past the Opo GCD straight into a Twin Snakes, we are able to get our buffs on cooldown sooner. These openers are generally used in situations where a phase or fight would end while we are still in a buff window in order to squeeze more effective usage out of those buffs.</description></item><item><title>The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/fight-tips/the-omega-protocol-ultimate/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 16:35:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/fight-tips/the-omega-protocol-ultimate/</guid><description>Hi it’s Mr PB here to talk to you about some ideas to keep in mind that should help you safely progress on your beetle-killing journey.

P5S Potion Usage Due to the fight being ten minutes long, using potion off cooldown for progression is recommended as that will get you three potions before enrage. However, it is fairly common for even undergeared parties to kill the boss before or around nine minutes, with kill times going as fast as near seven minutes now.
With this in mind, it is usually better to use your first potion at two minutes with a triple combo.</description></item><item><title>Scholar Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 16:46:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!

Introduction Dark Knight (DRK) is one of the four tanks available in Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker. Its rotation features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in actions per minute (APM) and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, putting many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows.

The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 04:45:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction While this guide is not intended as a complete resource for tanking in dungeons and trials, the following sections will provide a brief primer for those new to the role or who need a refresher.

The Double Dragons phase DPS check is low in terms of boss HP relative to enrage timer, but in practice can feel high for people who struggle to keep uptime amid its mechanics.
Other phases, however, are much more lenient with minimal uptime considerations.</description></item><item><title>Samurai Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/samurai/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 03:15:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/samurai/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!

While you should still aim to finish phases with as much Black and White mana as possible, in the scenario that your mana is at 50 | 50 or below, you can use Manafication during downtime during or between phases to get it on cooldown faster.</description></item><item><title>Asphodelos Raid Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/fight-tips/asphodelos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 03:47:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/fight-tips/asphodelos/</guid><description>6.x BLM Raid Guide By: Rika Vanih

P1S Intemperance Embolden should be used on cooldown, with the two-minute and six-minute buff windows occurring during Intemperance.
For the first Intemperance, as there is a delay between the Intemperance cast and the first set of tiles exploding, you can stand in the center of the arena to cast Embolden before moving out to your tile.</description></item><item><title>Summoner Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 03:04:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction Welcome! This page is written to assist you throughout your leveling journey and provide insight on how the Summoner job will evolve from level one to level 100. Summoner may appear as a bit of a “unique” job with a lot of moving parts and multiple avenues of attacking enemies. Throughout this leveling guide, we will provide you with a basic fundamental understanding of each spell that you will unlock, as well as provide some quick rotation priorities and visualization examples.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:18:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dark Knight Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:17:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sage Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 06:04:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Advanced SGE Guide Sage being relatively straightforward means that there&amp;rsquo;s not all that much for an &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; guide to cover. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to cover some of the areas that aren&amp;rsquo;t covered in the basic guide.
Phlegma Timings With the rework of Trick Attack in 6.1, it is no longer necessary to worry about odd-minute buff windows, as they no longer exist. Rather, any Phlegma that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in a two-minute buff window becomes free movement.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 05:39:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</guid><description>What Sect Should I Use? Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong. The gap in overall efficiency between Diurnal and Nocturnal Sect is still quite significant, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off of using Nocturnal Sect when the situation calls for it.</description></item><item><title>White Mage FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 04:43:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/faq/</guid><description>White Mage FAQ How should movement and weaving be handled? White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success. Below is a list of available options; keep in mind that it’s heavily subjective based on the encounter and your party.
Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes Natural Dia refresh (&amp;lt; ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog) Rapture that does useful healing, Misery Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below) Overheal Lilies Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable) Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.</description></item><item><title>Machinist Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 06:19:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Astrologian Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:17:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/admin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/admin/</guid><description>If you see this text, then something has gone wrong with the template generation.</description></item><item><title>Becoming A Better Tank</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/guide/becoming-a-better-tank/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/guide/becoming-a-better-tank/</guid><description>Version 1.0 Torael Valdis | Jenova (NA) | Torael_Valdis#8120
