So we&amp;rsquo;re here, finally with a proper writeup.
Making BiS was expected to be very difficult this tier with AST&amp;rsquo;s new affinity for SpS&amp;hellip;but instead it actually was quite easy. Avoid Piety like the plague and there you go, there&amp;rsquo;s your BiS pieces.
Higher Piety sets also have the nice consolation of having a wealth of Crit (rather than the traditional disgusting amounts of Det) so it won&amp;rsquo;t even feel that bad to swap to lower damage for the sake of Piety.</description></item><item><title>The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate) RDM Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/the-epic-of-alexander-ultimate-rdm-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 13:45:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/the-epic-of-alexander-ultimate-rdm-guide/</guid><description>Introduction Due to damage scaling in Endwalker and the potential for using fully synced gear, DPS checks in The Epic of Alexander are, on the whole, not extremely tight. Your primary concern for DPS will be the Trio Enrage at the end of Alexander Prime, but with fully synced gear options, phase DPS checks are fairly lenient.
At level 80, you can fit two full melee combos under Embolden, and this should be your goal whenever possible.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/openers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 08:36:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/openers/</guid><description>Dark Knight Openers and Rotation Dark Knight Openers DRK has several different options for openers, not all of which are listed here.

However, it is possible to do a basic IC IR IC opener, and keep IR on cooldown while managing mechanics. Yes, you can use IR before Limit Cut happens. You&amp;rsquo;ll get 2-3 IR FCs out.

We heard you needed some pointers on how to play WAR while leveling. The splits below are done based on what skills you unlock, and what you should take into account.
Do your job quests every five levels. Upgrade your gear every two to five levels. Remember your role actions. Gear We want Strength and Vitality. And Weapon Damage. Lots of Weapon Damage. The marketboard is a good place to pick up some cheap upgrades fast, along with Dungeon/Quest/Tomestone gear.</description></item><item><title>Warrior Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 20:05:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dancer Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 12:05:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Best-in-Slot (BiS) / Itemization Best-in-slot New BiS (5.55) with iLvl 535 Relic Weapon Old BiS (5.4) with Edenmorn Weapon - (watch melds)

Quick Glossary SCH: Scholar CD (Cooldown): The time it takes before you’re able to cast an action again. GCD (Global Cooldown): Spells that share the same base recast time.

You can weave one oGCD after it without clipping. Do not use Ruin II for weaving. New skills: Protraction and Expedient Shields apply at the slidecast window. It is now possible to cast Adloquium and immediately use Deployment Tactics, but this is still not recommended because this will clip GCD. Energy Drain no longer restores MP. Aetherflow MP is increased but this is a net loss for players who averaged 3+ Energy Drains per minute (including Energy Drains from Dissipation).</description></item><item><title>Scholar Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 02:52:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers/</guid><description>Remember that the exact ability usage in these openers is not strict. If you need to use a heal in the opener or hold an AF stack for later healing do so. This is the ability usage you&amp;rsquo;d do on a dummy, but not every fight allows for it.
Chain Stratagem is varied, there are several factors that impact its usage within a raid setting. Usually, it is dependent on composition, but may also need to be adjusted for fight timings, though these situations are fairly rare.</description></item><item><title>Scholar FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 02:52:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/faq/</guid><description>Scholar FAQ How can I see my fairy&amp;rsquo;s nameplate in battle?

Meld SpS to a comfy tier if you wish, low priority during prog.
Piety is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower iLvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don&amp;rsquo;t actively use lower iLvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself).</description></item><item><title>Paladin Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 06:07:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Paladin Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 06:06:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</guid><description>Paladin Openers Tanks currently use Grade 8 Tinctures of Strength (Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing).

There are six phases in this raid.

Why do we cast Verthunder twice?
Casting Verthunder twice is intentional as it allows us to guarantee a proc from Verholy as we will have lower white mana when we use it, resulting in us having both procs after our melee combo. You can also do this in the reverse order, casting Veraero twice and then Verflare.
Why are we potting a GCD later than usual?
Potting after the 2nd GCD allows us to use both Swiftcast and Acceleration after the first GCD, beginning the cooldown of both of those abilities and allowing us to comfortably weave our potion, Manafication, and Embolden in the next 2 GCDs.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 03:34:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/basic-guide/</guid><description>Red Mage Level 90 Guide for 6.x Overview This guide will cover proper rotations and ability usage in the Endwalker expansion.

Eukrasia itself is a 1-second, instant cast Global Cooldown (GCD) and the buffed ability will become a 1.5-second, instant-cast GCD. Neither of these cast times are affected by spell speed, so any Eukrasian GCD will always be 2.</description></item><item><title>Reaper Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 23:34:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/basic-guide/</guid><description>Basic Reaper Guide Welcome to the Basic Guide for Reaper, which will cover everything you need to know to get started with becoming a Reaper!

The core foundation of Summoner has changed significantly, most notably with the complete removal of damage over time abilities (dots) and the newly added primal arcanum system (gems). The basic flow and idea of Summoner’s rotation can be simplified as follows:
Use Searing Light in alignment with party raid buffs Summon Bahamut and use all abilities to refresh your primal gems Go through three primal phases Summon Phoenix and use all abilities to refresh your primal gems Go through three primal phases Repeat Within that framework, there is additional nuance such as optimizing damage into raid buffs, moving certain spells around based on movement requirements, and making effective use of Summoner’s various utility tools.</description></item><item><title>Reaper Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 23:33:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ninja Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 23:33:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/basic-guide/</guid><description>If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the #nin_questions channel.
Overview Ninja is a fast-paced yet flexible job with a high focus on a powerful burst every one and two minutes. It is unique from other jobs with its utilization of Ninjutsus, a combo-like system that allows a Ninja to form a multitude of ranged attacks.

Q: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
A: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority.</description></item><item><title>Reaper Job Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 18:05:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ninja Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 18:02:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Best-in-Slot (BiS) For your Best-in-Slot gear, you will generally be going for Weapon Damage&amp;gt; Dexterity&amp;gt; Crit&amp;gt; Direct Hit&amp;gt; Determination &amp;raquo; Skill Speed.

Raiden Thrust is an upgraded True Thrust. It combos into both Disembowel and Vorpal Thrust and replaces True Thrust on your bar when it’s ready.

Dragoons use Maiming armor and Slaying accessories. Low level gear may not be labeled as such, so make sure you always equip gear that gives a bonus to Strength.

Job Overview Black Mage is a caster specializing in high, steady personal damage in place of providing party buffs. The job maintains a cyclical flow of expending MP via long, powerful casts in Astral Fire then swapping to refresh MP in Umbral Ice. While the rotation itself is somewhat simple, utilizing its movement tools and the flexibility built into its rotation to their fullest is key to maintaining uptime and maximizing damage as a Black Mage.</description></item><item><title>Gunbreaker Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 13:28:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/basic-guide/</guid><description>Gunbreaker Rotation Guide Authors Krom Ulus | Adamantoise (Aether) | discord: krom.ulus

Circle of Scorn is used before Fight or Flight in most openers and kept on cooldown in most phases for two reasons:
Its short cooldown (25 seconds) is equal to the duration of Fight or Flight, meaning one CoS usage should always occur during FoF regardless of their respective timings, given full uptime. Its high DoT uptime (~60%) means that any delays are likely to cost ticks at the end of the phase, resulting in a potency loss overall.</description></item><item><title>Monk Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 14:29:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Advanced Monk Gameplay Techniques: Reaching Enlightenment Opener Variations The two basic opener choices are not going to work perfectly in every situation.

Early Openers An early opener is exactly what it sounds like. By skipping past the Opo GCD straight into a Twin Snakes, we are able to get our buffs on cooldown sooner. These openers are generally used in situations where a phase or fight would end while we are still in a buff window in order to squeeze more effective usage out of those buffs.</description></item><item><title>Monk Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 14:15:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/openers/</guid><description>Openers Other Resources Rotation Looping rotation French translation https://i.imgur.com/oNLFJOi.png

This information on this page is to give useful tips to help you as you are leveling DNC. This guide will focus on which skills and abilities are available to you in each level range, and will indicate at which levels you get actions that affect your rotation and how they affect it.
Basics Gear First of all, the gear you get from the quest unlocking DNC is not the best gear you can wear on DNC at level 60.</description></item><item><title>Abyssos</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/abyssos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 18:05:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/abyssos/</guid><description>For information on Addle and Magick Barrier usage, see https://bit.ly/3AHEMxZ
P5S Potion Usage Due to the fight being ten minutes long, using potion off cooldown for progression is recommended as that will get you three potions before enrage. However, it is fairly common for even undergeared parties to kill the boss before or around nine minutes, with kill times going as fast as near seven minutes now.
With this in mind, it is usually better to use your first potion at two minutes with a triple combo.</description></item><item><title>Scholar Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 16:46:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!

Piety is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower iLvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don&amp;rsquo;t actively use lower iLvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself).</description></item><item><title>White Mage Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 16:35:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!

Introduction Dark Knight (DRK) is one of the four tanks available in Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker. Its rotation features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in actions per minute (APM) and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, putting many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows.

The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 04:45:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction While this guide is not intended as a complete resource for tanking in dungeons and trials, the following sections will provide a brief primer for those new to the role or who need a refresher.

Wildfire does not scale with skill speed, so once it’s placed in your opener it will never move forward and can only be delayed in your rotation.

You can use Hypercharge freely when above 50 heat as long as four conditions are met:

The Double Dragons phase DPS check is low in terms of boss HP relative to enrage timer, but in practice can feel high for people who struggle to keep uptime amid its mechanics.
Other phases, however, are much more lenient with minimal uptime considerations.</description></item><item><title>Samurai Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/samurai/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 03:15:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/samurai/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!

Since the 6.1 changes, we can now use Searing Light in Bahamut, and choose to do so after the Bahamut GCD to avoid using a &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; GCD in our buff. You can choose to omit the precast Ruin III and use Bahamut at 0s as well. This may be an optimization strategy for particular fight timelines or encounters where the gained one second on cycle progression may matter.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 06:39:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/basic-guide/</guid><description>Introduction This is the Basic Guide for Astrologian. This will cover enough ground to get you started with AST, being able to handle this relatively high-input job in content at level 90. It is intended to be well-suited for any player, and if you take the advice and techniques from this guide you should be able to handle yourself well-enough in endgame content.
As this guide is relatively basic and does not go into any of the complexities of Astrologian, there will, of course, be gaps of knowledge, and some aspects of this fairly high-intensity job will be glossed over.</description></item><item><title>Sage Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/openers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 06:39:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/openers/</guid><description>Standard Opener Full Size

In this guide, you will find a series of details and optimizations for Endwalker Bard.
This builds on the Bard Basic Guide and expects you to be familiar with Bard&amp;rsquo;s skills, general priorities, opener, and song cycle.
Topics are ordered based on some mix of importance and flow. It is a little all over the place, but such is the nature of a kit like Bard&amp;rsquo;s.
The two-minute burst Like many jobs, Bard&amp;rsquo;s kit revolves around a big damage burst every two minutes, alongside a powerful duo of party-wide buffs, Battle Voice and Radiant Finale.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 04:58:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</guid><description>Notable Endwalker Changes New Skills: Astrodyne, Macrocosmos, Exaltation, Minor Arcana.

As a result of there being no damage buff it should be used slightly differently than in level 80 and 90 content.
While you should still aim to finish phases with as much Black and White mana as possible, in the scenario that your mana is at 50 | 50 or below, you can use Manafication during downtime during or between phases to get it on cooldown faster.</description></item><item><title>Asphodelos Raid Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/fight-tips/asphodelos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 03:47:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/fight-tips/asphodelos/</guid><description>6.x BLM Raid Guide By: Rika Vanih

Certain actions will deal more damage when executed from the rear or flank of a target. Targets with continuous Target Rings will always take the increased damage from positional actions. The Role Action True North allows you to disregard positional requirements for ten seconds per use.
While it is a loss to miss your Positionals, landing them should be your last priority, after you have met all of the other combat priority requirements of a melee DPS job.</description></item><item><title>Asphodelos Raid Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/asphodelos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 19:24:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/asphodelos/</guid><description>Red Mage Asphodelos Encounter Advice For information on Addle and Magick Barrier usage, see https://bit.ly/3AHEMxZ
P1S Intemperance Embolden should be used on cooldown, with the two-minute and six-minute buff windows occurring during Intemperance.
For the first Intemperance, as there is a delay between the Intemperance cast and the first set of tiles exploding, you can stand in the center of the arena to cast Embolden before moving out to your tile.</description></item><item><title>Summoner Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 03:04:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction Welcome! This page is written to assist you throughout your leveling journey and provide insight on how the Summoner job will evolve from level one to level 80. Summoner may appear as a bit of a “unique” job with a lot of moving parts and multiple avenues of attacking enemies. Throughout this leveling guide, we will provide you with a basic fundamental understanding of each spell that you will unlock, as well as provide some quick rotation priorities and visualization examples.</description></item><item><title>Machinist Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 06:23:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/basic-guide/</guid><description>Basic Machinist Guide Welcome to the Basic Machinist Guide!

I&amp;rsquo;ll try to cover some of the areas that aren&amp;rsquo;t covered in the basic guide.
Phlegma Timings With the rework of Trick Attack in 6.1, it is no longer necessary to worry about odd-minute buff windows, as they no longer exist. Rather, any Phlegma that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in a two-minute buff window becomes free movement.</description></item><item><title>Summoner Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:16:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/stat-priority/</guid><description>As a general rule we recommend:
SpS to 2.46-2.48 &amp;gt; Crit &amp;gt; Det &amp;gt;= DH &amp;gt; More SpS
There is an alternative way to play the job that focuses on maximizing SpS and minimizing Crit instead, which would use this priority:
SpS &amp;gt; Det &amp;gt;= DH &amp;gt; Crit
In general, the Crit set appears better for most situations. Spell speed as a stat excels when it can be fine-tuned around a fight’s timeline, but you can choose to use the SpS set blindly if you wish.</description></item><item><title>Monk Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 11:28:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Astrologian FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 05:39:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</guid><description>What Sect Should I Use? Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong. The gap in overall efficiency between Diurnal and Nocturnal Sect is still quite significant, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off of using Nocturnal Sect when the situation calls for it.</description></item><item><title>White Mage FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 04:43:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/faq/</guid><description>White Mage FAQ How should movement and weaving be handled? White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success. Below is a list of available options; keep in mind that it’s heavily subjective based on the encounter and your party.
Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes Natural Dia refresh (&amp;lt; ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog) Rapture that does useful healing, Misery Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below) Overheal Lilies Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable) Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.</description></item><item><title>Bard FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/faq/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 04:37:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/faq/</guid><description>Single target FAQ When should I use Raging Strikes after the opener?
A couple of GCDs into Minuet. This is to cover as much Pitch Perfect potential as possible.
When do I use my second/third potion?
Try to cover Raging Strikes and Barrage with it. That damage spike is bigger than any heap of party buffs. If you can, also try to pop it right before an Iron Jaws, so that you can IJ at the end and get two runs of buffed DoTs.</description></item><item><title>Monk FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/faq/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 11:17:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/faq/</guid><description>Is Double True Strike dead?
As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin Snakes and True.
What&amp;rsquo;s with the double Dragon Kick in the openers?
With Standard, you DK after Perfect Balance for DK&amp;rsquo;s higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally. With Early Buff a stanceless Leaden Boot after PB is worse on average than using the DK to guarantee a crit one.
