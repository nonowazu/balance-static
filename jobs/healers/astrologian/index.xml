This will cover enough ground to get you started with AST, being able to handle this relatively high-input job in content at level 90. It is intended to be well-suited for any player, and if you take the advice and techniques from this guide you should be able to handle yourself well-enough in endgame content.
As this guide is relatively basic and does not go into any of the complexities of Astrologian, there will, of course, be gaps of knowledge, and some aspects of this fairly high-intensity job will be glossed over.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 22:59:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Astrologian Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 03:15:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!

Keep in mind that Astrologian openers are somewhat flexible, and can be adjusted based on the context of a fight, or any given burst window.
For clarity, The Balance and The Spear are not being used on you. They are to demonstrate their timings relative to our own buffs. Please do not card yourself in raids (Lightspeed can be used anywhere after that first combust to a late weave after the following Fall Malefic.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 23:34:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction This guide is intended to help you level Astrologian to level 90 from any given starting point, while also beginning to slowly suggest fundamental strategies and techniques. Habits develop early, and practice makes permanent.
This guide is not intended to be a complete guide on how to heal in dungeons, trials, or any other content. However, the following section is intended to give some strategies to the mindset of a healer in XIV, and I recommend you read it if you have never been a healer in specifically XIV-related max-level content before.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 04:58:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</guid><description>Notable Endwalker Changes New Skills: Astrodyne, Macrocosmos, Exaltation, Minor Arcana.

Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong. The gap in overall efficiency between Diurnal and Nocturnal Sect is still quite significant, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off of using Nocturnal Sect when the situation calls for it.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:17:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
