So we&amp;rsquo;re here, finally with a proper writeup.
Making BiS was expected to be very difficult this tier with AST&amp;rsquo;s new affinity for SpS&amp;hellip;but instead it actually was quite easy. Avoid Piety like the plague and there you go, there&amp;rsquo;s your BiS pieces.
Higher Piety sets also have the nice consolation of having a wealth of Crit (rather than the traditional disgusting amounts of Det) so it won&amp;rsquo;t even feel that bad to swap to lower damage for the sake of Piety.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 03:15:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!

Keep in mind that Astrologian openers are extremely flexible and depend almost entirely on the circumstances of the fight, the timings of the planned raid DPS bursts, and party composition. Any premade Astrologian opener is a generic framework, not a universally optimal opener.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of care to evaluate as many of the variables as we reasonably can and identify the core methodology of the most statistically successful opener with regard to when most DPS jobs burst the hardest and when other raid buffs should be coming out, assuming everyone is doing a proper opener.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 23:34:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction This guide is intended to help you level Astrologian to level 90 from any given starting point, while also beginning to slowly suggest fundamental strategies and techniques. Habits develop early, and practice makes permanent.
This guide is not intended to be a complete guide on how to heal in dungeons, trials, or any other content. However, the following section is intended to give some strategies to the mindset of a healer in XIV, and I recommend you read it if you have never been a healer in specifically XIV-related max-level content before.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 06:39:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/basic-guide/</guid><description>Introduction This is the Basic Guide for Astrologian. This will cover enough ground to get you started with AST, being able to handle this relatively high-input job in content at level 90. It is intended to be well-suited for any player, and if you take the advice and techniques from this guide you should be able to handle yourself well-enough in endgame content.
As this guide is relatively basic and does not go into any of the complexities of Astrologian, there will, of course, be gaps of knowledge, and some aspects of this fairly high-intensity job will be glossed over.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 04:58:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</guid><description>Notable Endwalker Changes New Skills: Astrodyne, Macrocosmos, Exaltation, Minor Arcana.

Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong. The gap in overall efficiency between Diurnal and Nocturnal Sect is still quite significant, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off of using Nocturnal Sect when the situation calls for it.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:17:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
