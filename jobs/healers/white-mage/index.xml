As healers do not have a strict healing rotation, this guide will focus on highlighting what makes each skill unique and explain some common use cases.
White Mage is considered by many people to be the most beginner friendly healer, and rightfully so.</description></item><item><title>White Mage Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 16:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>White Mage Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 16:37:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/stat-priority/</guid><description>In general this will boil down to choosing max item level gear with sufficient Piety while maximizing Crit, then melding Crit &amp;gt; DH/DET where possible, though Piety melds can be useful in a pinch if you end up too low.
Piety is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower iLvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don&amp;rsquo;t actively use lower iLvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself).</description></item><item><title>White Mage Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 16:35:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!

-3s Pre-pull Current Tincture of Mind
-1.5s Pre-pull Glare III
PULL
Dia
Glare III
Glare III Weave: Presence of Mind
Glare III Weave: Assize Glare III (etc.)
This opener uses both PoM and Assize under raid buffs, Assize is weaved under PoM which can cause clipping even at moderate ping, in most cases this will not be an issue.

You can find the vendors in Mor Dhona (50), Idyllshire (60), Rhalgr&amp;rsquo;s Reach (70), and Eulmore (80).</description></item><item><title>White Mage Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 16:41:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/skills-overview/</guid><description>Notable Endwalker Changes Thin Air has two charges but only reduces mana cost on one spell per cast.

White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success. Below is a list of available options; keep in mind that itâ€™s heavily subjective based on the encounter and your party.
Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes Natural Dia refresh (&amp;lt; ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog) Rapture that does useful healing, Misery Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below) Overheal Lilies Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable) Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.</description></item></channel></rss>
