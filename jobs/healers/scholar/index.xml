Below, we’ll briefly describe all Scholar actions, grouped by level, and some general guidelines for when to use them. For more detailed ability descriptions, please consult the in-game tooltips or job guide, and if you’d like to learn more about playing and optimizing Scholar, check out our other guides.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="quick-glossary">Quick Glossary&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SCH:&lt;/strong> Scholar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CD (Cooldown):&lt;/strong> The time it takes before you’re able to cast an action again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>GCD (Global Cooldown):&lt;/strong> Spells that share the same base recast time. On SCH, these are mostly spells with about 2.5s recast time, plus Resurrection. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Instant (Instant Cast):&lt;/strong> GCD Spells that do not have a cast bar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>oGCD (Off Global Cooldown):&lt;/strong> Abilities that don’t share the 2.5s base recast time and therefore can be used while GCD spells are on cooldown.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Weaving:&lt;/strong> Using oGCDs in between GCDs. To avoid delaying your GCD, you can safely weave 2 oGCDs after an instant cast GCD, or 1 oGCD after your casted damaging GCD.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>HoT (Heal over Time):&lt;/strong> Actions that heal the target over a period of time. These actions heal for their listed potency once every 3 seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Regen:&lt;/strong> Another word for HoT&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>DoT (Damage over Time):&lt;/strong> Actions that damage the target over a period of time. These actions deal damage for their listed potency once every 3 seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>AoE (Area of Effect):&lt;/strong> Actions that affect every target in a specified area. AoE heals heal all allies in a circle around their source. AoE damage abilities affect all enemies in an area specified by the ability; enemies can perform AoE attacks too.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>AF (Aetherflow):&lt;/strong> The level 45 SCH ability. The resource stacks it grants and the abilities that cost Aetherflow are often called “AF stacks” and “AF abilities”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>HP (Health Points):&lt;/strong> Your life. Don’t let this hit 0.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>MP (Mana Points):&lt;/strong> The resource that allows you to cast spells. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

This is the ability usage you&amp;rsquo;d do on a dummy, but not every fight allows for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dissipation First Openers:&lt;/strong> You can swap the place of Aetherflow and Dissipation in both of the above openers. This can have several advantages: the fairy comes back about 15s earlier due to an earlier Dissipation (giving you access to her healing again), the 2000mp from Aetherflow comes later (meaning it won&amp;rsquo;t be wasted to overcapping), and it aligns Aetherflow correctly for a six ED buff window at two minutes. The last benefit is minor as you can simply delay the two minute Aetherflow instead if using an Aetherflow first opener. The main drawback of doing a Dissipation first opener is the risk of losing an Aetherflow use over the course of the fight or the phase, though this risk is shared by any rotation that does six ED buff windows every two minutes. It also changes the timings of when you get AF stacks back which make an impact on your healing plan. Consider the positives and negatives of Dissipation first when planning out the fight.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scholar FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 02:52:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/faq/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="scholar-faq">Scholar FAQ&lt;/h1>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>How can I see my fairy&amp;rsquo;s nameplate in battle?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A. Character Configuration &amp;gt; Control Settings &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Target&amp;rdquo; tab &amp;gt; Under &amp;ldquo;Target Settings&amp;rdquo;, Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Disable targeting of pets and minions when in battle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>B. Character Config &amp;gt; Display Name Settings &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Own&amp;rdquo; tab &amp;gt; Under &amp;ldquo;Pets&amp;rdquo; set &amp;ldquo;Display Name Settings&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Always&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;During Battle&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both options must be set this way or your fairy&amp;rsquo;s nameplate will be hidden.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scholar Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 02:52:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/stat-priority/</guid><description>&lt;p>Consider melding Det over DH for prog, as the damage benefits are basically equal on average. Meld SpS to a comfy tier if you wish, low priority during prog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Piety&lt;/strong> is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower iLvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don&amp;rsquo;t actively use lower iLvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself). It&amp;rsquo;s hard to predict exactly how much Piety you might need in most settings, but you can take a look at how much the recommended sets take in each setting and decide which one fits you best.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scholar Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 16:46:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/advanced-guide/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!
