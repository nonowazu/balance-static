If you need to use a heal in the opener or hold an AF stack for later healing do so. This is the ability usage you&amp;rsquo;d do on a dummy, but not every fight allows for it.
Dissipation First Openers: You can swap the place of Aetherflow and Dissipation in both of the above openers. This can have several advantages: the fairy comes back about 15s earlier due to an earlier Dissipation (giving you access to her healing again), the 2000mp from Aetherflow comes later (meaning it won&amp;rsquo;t be wasted to overcapping), and it aligns Aetherflow correctly for a six ED buff window at two minutes.</description></item><item><title>Scholar Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 20:34:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/skills-overview/</guid><description>Notable Dawntrail Changes New skills: Baneful Impaction and Seraphism Swiftcast cooldown reduced to 40s with a trait.

A. Character Configuration &amp;gt; Control Settings &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Target&amp;rdquo; tab &amp;gt; Under &amp;ldquo;Target Settings&amp;rdquo;, Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Disable targeting of pets and minions when in battle.&amp;rdquo;
B. Character Config &amp;gt; Display Name Settings &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Own&amp;rdquo; tab &amp;gt; Under &amp;ldquo;Pets&amp;rdquo; set &amp;ldquo;Display Name Settings&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Always&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;During Battle&amp;rdquo;
Both options must be set this way or your fairy&amp;rsquo;s nameplate will be hidden.</description></item><item><title>Scholar Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 02:52:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/stat-priority/</guid><description>Consider melding Det over DH for prog, as the damage benefits are basically equal on average. Meld SpS to a comfy tier if you wish, low priority during prog.
Piety is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower iLvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don&amp;rsquo;t actively use lower iLvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself).</description></item><item><title>Scholar Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 16:46:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!
