This guide is meant to be fairly basic and does not cover every little detail. However, it should point you in the right general direction and give you a feel for the class.

These are upgraded versions of other skills that you would access by using the &amp;ldquo;Eukrasia&amp;rdquo; skill first. For example, to cast Eukrasian Dosis, first cast Eukrasia, then cast Dosis. Eukrasia itself is a 1-second, instant cast Global Cooldown (GCD) and the buffed ability will become a 1.5-second, instant-cast GCD. Neither of these cast times are affected by spell speed, so any Eukrasian GCD will always be 2.</description></item><item><title>Sage Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 08:52:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sage Job Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 08:52:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sage Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 05:32:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction While Sage starts out at level 70, you may find yourself synced to lower level ranges when leveling through roulettes, and this guide aims to cover what options you have at each level range. Even if you want to level Sage exclusively using 70+ content, you can use this guide as an explanation of your large mitigation/healing toolkit and how they work together with a focus on healing dungeon content; though the guidelines introduced are applicable to all PvE content in this game.</description></item><item><title>Sage Best in Slot</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 00:49:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sage FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/faq/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 06:37:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/faq/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sage Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 06:04:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Advanced SGE Guide Sage being relatively straightforward means that there&amp;rsquo;s not all that much for an &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; guide to cover. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to cover some of the areas that aren&amp;rsquo;t covered in the basic guide.
Phlegma Timings With the rework of Trick Attack in 6.1, it is no longer necessary to worry about odd-minute buff windows, as they no longer exist. Rather, any Phlegma that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in a two-minute buff window becomes free movement.</description></item></channel></rss>
