If you are still leveling, you should start with the leveling guide, and if you&amp;rsquo;re still learning, you should start with the the basic guide, and build familiarity with Dark Knight&amp;rsquo;s kit first.

Introduction Dark Knight (DRK) is one of the four tanks available in Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. Its rotation features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in actions per minute (APM) and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, putting many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows.

Encounter-specific opener information may be found in the drk_encounter channel of the Balance discord, or on fight-specific guides, where applicable. This section will list general-purpose DRK openers, which work well for most situations, and provide an overview of how openers are chosen.
