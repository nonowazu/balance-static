Fight timings and party composition can both affect which opener is best, based on when you can keep uptime on the boss and when raid buffs are used. Fight-specific opener information can be found in #drk_encounter and #drk_questions (often in the pins). This section will list some General-purpose DRK openers which work relatively well in most situations.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 09:16:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Dark Knight Best In Slot Day one prog set(s) will be listed immediately when a new tier is released, but pre-BiS sets will otherwise not be maintained on this page. Use the Tank Gear Manager (https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) to make your own gearing decisions based on what gear is available to you.

Introduction Dark Knight (DRK) is one of the four tanks available in Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker. Its rotation features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in actions per minute (APM) and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, putting many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows. It also has access to one of the most powerful single-target mitigation abilities available in The Blackest Night (TBN).</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/faq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 04:45:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions Why can’t I fit five GCDs in Blood Weapon (or Delirium)? The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent.
