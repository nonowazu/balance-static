Encounter-specific opener information may be found in the drk_encounter channel of the Balance discord, or on fight-specific guides, where applicable. This section will list general-purpose DRK openers, which work well for most situations, and provide an overview of how openers are chosen.

With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 03:13:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!
