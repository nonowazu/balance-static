There’s the case of pushing out “3 IC Pot” and &amp;ldquo;2 Ruin Pot&amp;rdquo; windows and other rotational niches, but also disrespecting various mechanics by zeroing out the damage, or canceling a knockback with our Onslaught. Also, if you want a high percentile in FFLogs, you&amp;rsquo;re at the mercy of a good kill time and Crit RNG.</description></item><item><title>Warrior Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/openers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 12:50:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/openers/</guid><description>Warrior Openers and Rotation Warriors prepare their burst while waiting for the party buffs to appear.
After the buffs are up, the skills are used more or less in order of importance, as to gain potential re-uses towards the end of the fight.
Opener Optimization Assumed Timings:
Tomahawk starts at -0.70s and the pull starts at 0.00s Party buffs are expected to be up at around 7.80s, right when the first Inner Chaos goes out.</description></item><item><title>Warrior Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 12:49:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/basic-guide/</guid><description>Final Fantasy 14: Endwalker guide for Warrior By Mox Xinmagar &amp;amp; The Happy Team of Warriors

Intro Hello team! There should be an intro here, but I am bad at writing those.
Therefore I shall skip the funny talks about the Angriest Healer of FFXIV and let the rest of the guide do the talking.
This intro is focused on Lvl90 Endwalker Warrior. Please get to level 90 soon.</description></item><item><title>Warrior Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 12:49:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Henlo team!
We heard you needed some pointers on how to play WAR while leveling. The splits below are done based on what skills you unlock, and what you should take into account.
Do your job quests every five levels. Upgrade your gear every two to five levels. Remember your role actions. Gear We want Strength and Vitality. And Weapon Damage. Lots of Weapon Damage. The marketboard is a good place to pick up some cheap upgrades fast, along with Dungeon/Quest/Tomestone gear.</description></item><item><title>Warrior Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 12:48:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Warrior FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/faq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 12:40:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/faq/</guid><description>Lvl70: Single Target vs AoE (Two Targets)?
TL;DR: Very equal, but lvl70 ST wins by a small margin
How do I relic?
Cap Crit, cap Det Check if you can replace any SkS melds in your gear with Det Get any missing SkS through relic Fill the rest of the relic with TNC How do I Upheaval?
All the time. I&amp;rsquo;m using Inner Release&amp;rsquo;s recast timer as a visual guide whether to hit Upheaval or not.</description></item><item><title>Warrior Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 12:51:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/skills-overview/</guid><description>Warrior Skills Overview Abilities will be presented in a tabular format for easy reading.

Weapon Damage &amp;raquo;&amp;gt; Main Stat &amp;raquo;&amp;raquo; Substats. Very few exceptions have existed before Endwalker. Early Expansion (pre-7.05):
Comfy SkS &amp;gt; DH &amp;gt; Crit This results in mostly DH melds across the gear This priority changes once we get more Crit from gear, supposedly in patch 7.05 Warrior Substat priority and melds:
Crit &amp;gt; Comfy SkS &amp;gt; DH &amp;gt;= Det &amp;gt; TNC Be mindful of stat tiers when melding.</description></item></channel></rss>
