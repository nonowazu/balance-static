Encounter-specific optimizations can be discussed in the PLD Encounter forum in the Balance Discord.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 07:27:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Paladin Best in Slot Gear Priority and Pre-BiS Day one prog set(s) will be listed immediately when a new tier is released, but pre-BiS will otherwise not be maintained on this page. Use the Tank Gear Manager (https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) to make your own gearing decisions based on personal loot availability. Prioritizing item level over substats is encouraged while learning new encounters.
Note: Early progression gear will often provide very different skill speed values from BiS.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 06:07:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Paladin Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 06:06:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</guid><description>Paladin Openers Tanks currently use Grade 8 Tinctures of Strength (Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing).

Whether you are a fresh level 90, a returning player, or just need a refresher, this guide will get you started and allow you to hit the ground running.
Since this is a basic introduction to level 90 Paladin, this guide will not go into many nuances and topics that are tied to high-end optimization. If you are looking for such information, you may find it in one of the dedicated guides below:</description></item><item><title>Paladin Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 01:19:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Paladin FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/faq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 01:14:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/faq/</guid><description>Why is Circle of Scorn used immediately in the opener?
Circle of Scorn is used before Fight or Flight in most openers and kept on cooldown in most phases for two reasons:
Its short cooldown (25 seconds) is equal to the duration of Fight or Flight, meaning one CoS usage should always occur during FoF regardless of their respective timings, given full uptime. Its high DoT uptime (~60%) means that any delays are likely to cost ticks at the end of the phase, resulting in a potency loss overall.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 03:22:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Paladin Leveling Dungeon Tips Keeping Aggro Turn on Iron Will and never turn it off. As long as you keep hitting the mobs, you will have aggro on them. In multi-target situations, use AoE so that you can keep aggro on all mobs.
Pulling Mobs There are a variety of ways to ensure you pull all of the mobs in a pack quickly and reliably, without stopping on your way to the next pack of mobs.</description></item></channel></rss>
