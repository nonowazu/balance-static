It shaves off quite a bit of time to get the cooldown rolling and could possibly net us an extra usage depending on the fight layout in Dawntrail. Depending on the fight, we can transpose Drill and Air Anchor in the opener if we can gain an extra Drill for it.</description></item><item><title>Machinist Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 12:15:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/advanced-guide/</guid><description>This guide is intended to give the reader the tools needed to approach encounter optimization as a Machinist.

You can use Hypercharge freely when above 50 heat as long as four conditions are met:
Drill and Air Anchor have more than eight to ten seconds left on cooldown You will not break your combo. (It will break if you try to carry it over HC + Drill + Anchor.) You have 0-1 Gauss Round and Ricochet charges stored. You are using Wildfire or will have enough heat for it later when you need it.</description></item><item><title>Machinist Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 20:23:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Machinist Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 06:19:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
