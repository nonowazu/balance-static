Whether youâ€™re a fresh level 100, a returning player, or just need a refresher, this guide will get you started and help you feel comfortable.
This is a basic introduction to level 100 Bard. It will not go into many nuances, optimizations, or topics outside of playing the job in battle. In particular, this will not cover a range of nuances that aim to keep key skills on cooldown despite Bard&amp;rsquo;s shifting speeds.</description></item><item><title>Bard Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 02:39:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Bard Leveling Guide Gear Always use the gear with the highest dexterity available to you. This is more important than any secondary stat - you should not worry about those until endgame.
Aside from some early quest rewards and vendor gear bought for gil, a piece&amp;rsquo;s item level correlates to its Dexterity. So you can just use the highest item level gear and you&amp;rsquo;ll be good to go.
Bards use &amp;ldquo;Aiming&amp;rdquo; gear, so if you see that label on a coffer quest reward, that one is for you.</description></item><item><title>Bard Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 02:09:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/openers/</guid><description>Bard Openers There are a few other openers you will see around, but the two below are the main general-purpose intermediate options.
For all openers:
Any given Burst Shot in the image could be Refulgent Arrow, or vice versa save for the one using Barrage. Use Pitch Perfect at three stacks as able, Heartbreak Shot as able, and Refulgent procs as you get them. Try to use your first skill as the countdown hits zero (not before).</description></item><item><title>Bard Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 15:21:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/best-in-slot/</guid><description>5.5x Best In Slot BiS with Relic: https://etro.gg/gearset/8418d22e-d70e-4b1a-87e0-d2b79dc3bd91

A couple of GCDs into Minuet. This is to cover as much Pitch Perfect potential as possible.
When do I use my second/third potion?
Try to cover Raging Strikes and Barrage with it. That damage spike is bigger than any heap of party buffs. If you can, also try to pop it right before an Iron Jaws, so that you can IJ at the end and get two runs of buffed DoTs.</description></item><item><title>Bard Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 21:31:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/skills-overview/</guid><description>Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find notes and clarifications about Bard&amp;rsquo;s skills. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for tooltips, check the official website.
GCDs (share a Global Cooldown) Burst Shot (BS) Your go-to filler GCD on single targets. Use Burst Shot when you have no other GCDs you need to press. Refulgent Arrow (RA) Refulgent Arrow is usable when you have the &amp;ldquo;Hawk&amp;rsquo;s Eye&amp;rdquo; buff. You can get this buff by using Burst Shot, Stormbite, Caustic Bite, Iron Jaws, or Ladonsbite.</description></item><item><title>Bard Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 03:49:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Bard Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 22:19:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Hello! In this guide, you will find a series of details and optimizations for Endwalker Bard.
This builds on the Bard Basic Guide and expects you to be familiar with Bard&amp;rsquo;s skills, general priorities, opener, and song cycle.
Topics are ordered based on some mix of importance and flow. It is a little all over the place, but such is the nature of a kit like Bard&amp;rsquo;s.
The two-minute burst Like many jobs, Bard&amp;rsquo;s kit revolves around a big damage burst every two minutes, alongside a powerful duo of party-wide buffs, Battle Voice and Radiant Finale.</description></item></channel></rss>
