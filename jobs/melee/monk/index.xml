Certain actions will deal more damage when executed from the rear or flank of a target. Targets with continuous Target Rings will always take the increased damage from positional actions. The Role Action True North allows you to disregard positional requirements for ten seconds per use.
While it is a loss to miss your Positionals, landing them should be your last priority, after you have met all of the other combat priority requirements of a melee DPS job.</description></item><item><title>Monk Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 01:09:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Monk Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 00:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Monk FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 00:29:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/faq/</guid><description>Is Double True Strike dead?
As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin Snakes and True.
What&amp;rsquo;s with the double Dragon Kick in the openers?
With Standard, you DK after Perfect Balance for DK&amp;rsquo;s higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally. With Early Buff a stanceless Leaden Boot after PB is worse on average than using the DK to guarantee a crit one.
What do non opener RoF windows look like?</description></item><item><title>Monk Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 00:14:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/openers/</guid><description>Openers &amp;ldquo;Which opener do I pick?&amp;rdquo; It depends on when your group is bursting. 5/7s don&amp;rsquo;t have any major implications one way or the other for us, so do what fits your party the best.
The choice between demo opener and dk opener will likely depend on your group’s buff timings or fight phasing: choose dk opener as the default.
As always, the choice between double lunar and solar lunar depends on your killtime.</description></item><item><title>Monk Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 23:27:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Monk Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 00:32:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/skills-overview/</guid><description>Single Target GCDs Monk has six core single-target GCDs:
Bootshine has a potency of 210, or 310 when you have Leaden Fist. When in Opo-Opo form, Bootshine will always crit. Dragon Kick has a potency of 320. When in Opo-Opo form, it will grant the Leaden Fist buff. True Strike has a potency of 300. It can only be executed from Raptor form. Twin Snakes has a potency of 280. It also grants a 15% damage increase buff, Disciplined Fist, that lasts for 15 seconds.</description></item><item><title>Monk Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 14:29:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Advanced Monk Gameplay Techniques: Reaching Enlightenment Opener Variations The two basic opener choices are not going to work perfectly in every situation. As such, we can modify our openers quite easily in order to better suit our needs.
Early Openers An early opener is exactly what it sounds like. By skipping past the Opo GCD straight into a Twin Snakes, we are able to get our buffs on cooldown sooner. These openers are generally used in situations where a phase or fight would end while we are still in a buff window in order to squeeze more effective usage out of those buffs.</description></item></channel></rss>
