Burst windows can get hectic, and prioritizing the various skills you need to execute can become a rather significant hassle in some instances. Dawntrail has doubled down on this by introducing the ability to utilize even more oGCD actions at regular intervals, as if we didn’t have enough already.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 16:30:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Dragoon Leveling Guide Gear Always use the highest Item Level gear available to you. The increase of Strength and survivability outweighs potentially more favorable substats in lower Item Level gear. The total amount of substats is also higher.

With our new job design, it’s possible that we’ll actually have fight-specific openers down the stretch.
