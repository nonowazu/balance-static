With our new job design, it’s possible that we’ll actually have fight-specific openers down the stretch.

The backbone of ten GCDs in sequence will - in general - never be changed, but the two blocks of oGCDs (Buffs and Attacks) can be shuffled around within their respective slots if necessary to accommodate specific encounter timings.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 20:34:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Dragoon Best-in-Slot Lists 5.55 Best-in-Slot Gearsets 2.50 GCD (Raid Chest) - http://bit.ly/drg250raid

Ultimates Best-in-Slot Discussion If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to do one of the level 70 Ultimate encounters, you should just sync down current gear. If you wear anything with an Item Level higher than 418 for UCoB or 470 for UWU, you will maximize the two stats on the gear.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 18:06:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dragoon Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 14:01:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dragoon FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 14:00:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions Type !faq drg in #bot_spam for a full list of commands to answer other common questions!
How does Raiden Thrust work?
Raiden Thrust is an upgraded True Thrust. It combos into both Disembowel and Vorpal Thrust and replaces True Thrust on your bar when it’s ready. You activate it by successfully landing the positional on the fifth hit of your combo (Fang and Claw or Wheeling Thrust following Wheeling Thrust or Fang and Claw, respectively).</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 13:35:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/basic-guide/</guid><description>Saving The Dragoon Overview Dragoon is a relatively static melee DPS job with a high focus on weaving off-Global Cooldown (oGCD) actions between a rigid 10-hit sequence of Global Cooldown (GCD) actions. Burst windows can get hectic, and prioritizing the various skills you need to execute can become a rather significant hassle in some instances. Endwalker has doubled down on this by introducing the ability to utilize even more oGCD actions at regular intervals, as if we didn’t have enough already.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 13:33:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Dragoon Leveling Guide Gear Always use the highest Item Level gear available to you. The increase of Strength and survivability outweighs potentially more favorable substats in lower Item Level gear. The total amount of substats is also higher.
