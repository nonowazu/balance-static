Ultimates Best-in-Slot Discussion If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to do one of the level 70 Ultimate encounters, you should just sync down current gear. If you wear anything with an Item Level higher than 418 for UCoB or 470 for UWU, you will maximize the two stats on the gear.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 17:40:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/basic-guide/</guid><description>/jobs/melee/dragoon/opener/Saving The Dragoon Overview Dragoon is a relatively static melee DPS job with a high focus on weaving off-Global Cooldown (oGCD) actions between a rigid 10-hit sequence of Global Cooldown (GCD) actions. Burst windows can get hectic, and prioritizing the various skills you need to execute can become a rather significant hassle in some instances. Dawntrail has doubled down on this by introducing the ability to utilize even more oGCD actions at regular intervals, as if we didn’t have enough already.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 16:30:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Dragoon Leveling Guide Gear Always use the highest Item Level gear available to you. The increase of Strength and survivability outweighs potentially more favorable substats in lower Item Level gear. The total amount of substats is also higher.
Dragoons use Maiming armor and Slaying accessories. Low level gear may not be labeled as such, so make sure you always equip gear that gives a bonus to Strength.
Know Your Role Melee DPS jobs have a unique mechanic in Positionals.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/faq/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 11:18:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions Type !faq drg in #bot_spam for a full list of commands to answer other common questions!
How does Raiden Thrust work?
Raiden Thrust is an upgraded True Thrust. It combos into both Disembowel and Vorpal Thrust and replaces True Thrust on your bar when it’s ready. You activate it by successfully landing the positional on the fifth hit of your combo (Fang and Claw or Wheeling Thrust following Wheeling Thrust or Fang and Claw, respectively).</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 11:16:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dragoon Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/openers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 11:14:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/openers/</guid><description>Dragoon Opener and Rotation The primary use of the Opener is to prepare your cooldown alignment for the rest of the encounter. With our new job design, it’s possible that we’ll actually have fight-specific openers down the stretch.
Standard Opener We use our raidbuff Battle Litany after applying our DoT for party alignment, the rest of our buffs surround it with Geirskogul being used last to ensure its own potency is buffed by all our personal buffs and potential raidbuffs.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 11:01:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dragoon Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 10:59:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/skills-overview/</guid><description>Dragoon Skills Overview Global Cooldown Actions (Single Target) All potencies assume level 100, meaning potency increases through traits are already included.
