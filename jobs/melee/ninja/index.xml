Overview Ninja is a fast-paced yet flexible job with a high focus on a powerful burst every one and two minutes. It is unique from other jobs with its utilization of Ninjutsus, a combo-like system that allows a Ninja to form a multitude of ranged attacks. We have a personal buff every minute (Trick Attack) where we emphasize landing all of our biggest attacks within 15.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 00:33:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</guid><description>⦿ Late weave Trick Attack as much as possible without clipping. ⦿ Mug should be held a GCD after the opener (at next usage) then used strictly on cooldown after.
⦿ It is important to start preparing the Suiton prepull at -6 seconds on the countdown and use at -1 second. This will not pull the boss early and allows future mudras to come off cooldown sooner.
⦿ This version uses Trick Attack at the 4th GCD instead of the standard 3rd.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 18:07:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/stat-priority/</guid><description>Highest iLvl gear available generally will be the best option, regardless of substats, thanks to an increase in Dexterity and Weapon Damage. Between items of the same iLvl, the stat priority is Crit &amp;gt; DET &amp;gt; DH &amp;raquo;&amp;raquo; SkS.</description></item><item><title>Ninja FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 18:05:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions:
Q: Are there any Shukuchi macros?
A: Yes, the main ones use either to go to your target at the time, or use &amp;lt;1&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;2&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;3&amp;gt;, etc to go to specific party members.
Q: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
A: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 18:02:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Best-in-Slot (BiS) For your Best-in-Slot gear, you will generally be going for Weapon Damage&amp;gt; Dexterity&amp;gt; Crit&amp;gt; Direct Hit&amp;gt; Determination &amp;raquo; Skill Speed. This is not 100% exact once you get to the max gear, but until you have that, that is the priority in stats.
2.12 GCD BiS https://etro.gg/gearset/dec9811d-c02c-4378-b046-d3cebe42eccb
2.11 GCD BiS https://etro.gg/gearset/33b9d186-963a-4cdb-84a0-6b2ebbadc652
2.10 GCD BiS https://etro.gg/gearset/c1c01cbb-f99b-4ba8-bbe3-e9d03a76b280
Use the 2.12 GCD BiS for general play, the 2.11 plays around potential extra gcds and is more consistent at doing triple Bhavas in Tricks, which still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in every fight, and also requires a lower ping to work.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 03:12:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!
