It is unique from other jobs with its utilization of Ninjutsus, a combo-like system allowing a Ninja to form a multitude of ranged attacks. We have a personal buff every minute (Kunai's Bane) where we emphasize landing all of our biggest attacks within 16.25s, and a raid buff (Dokumori) every 2-minutes that lasts 21s.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 23:47:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/leveling-guide/</guid><description>This guide was written by Akashi for players who are seeking to, or are currently leveling Ninja.

⦿ It is important to start preparing the Suiton prepull at -6 seconds on the countdown and use at -1 second. This will not pull the boss early and allows future mudras to come off cooldown sooner.
⦿ This version uses Trick Attack at the 4th GCD instead of the standard 3rd.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 18:07:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/stat-priority/</guid><description>Highest iLvl gear available generally will be the best option, regardless of substats, thanks to an increase in Dexterity and Weapon Damage.

Q: Are there any Shukuchi macros?
A: Yes, the main ones use either to go to your target at the time, or use &amp;lt;1&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;2&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;3&amp;gt;, etc to go to specific party members.
Q: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
A: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 06:40:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/job-changes/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
