I am Reina, a caster player, and I am standing on the shoulders of giants. This document aims to provide a comprehensive guide on advanced non-standard playstyle (also known as the AI rotation). There is the assumption you know all of the basics of BLM, including abbreviations and fundamentals. If not, refer to the <a href=/jobs/casters/black-mage/basic-guide/>6.X Black Mage guide</a> before proceeding here. </p><p><strong>The standard rotation is more than sufficient to play at a high level of Black Mage.</strong> If you are looking to generally improve, use the standard rotation and work on the fundamentals such as achieving extremely high uptime, oGCD usage, slidecasting, and positioning. The optimizations listed here are meant for players with a great understanding of the fundamentals of BLM’s playstyle and rotation, and are already familiar with executing the rotation well in fights. Furthermore, non-standard is not required to do well in any high end content. <strong>Once again, non-standard is not the solution to low dps, and instead, work on your fundamentals.</strong> If you can maintain a substantially high uptime on BLM and are interested in learning alternative and potentially challenging BLM rotations, then I welcome you to read on. </p><p>This document is written in three sections such that you do not need the knowledge of later sections to utilize the former ones. You do not need to know everything about non-standard to utilize it, and you can choose the level of optimization you want to learn in this document. Undoubtedly, as time goes on, more BLM optimizations will be discovered. This document will aim to include any new discoveries prior to every major patch. Please see the Changelog section for reference. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me on Discord at Reina#0001. Finally, I want to thank the Black Mage theorycrafters on <a href=https://discord.com/invite/thebalanceffxiv>The Balance Discord</a> for providing the theories, structures of thought and mathematical calculations necessary for creating this document. </p><h1 id=basics>Basics</h1><h2 id=general-idea>General Idea</h2><p>The idea behind the optimizations in non-standard lines is the elimination of weak spells, F3, B3, and B4 which lower the average potency per second (PPS) of the rotation. We do this by utilizing Transpose with F3s in AF1 in place of weak UI3 F3s, resulting in a potency gain. In addition, we also use Transpose to transition from AF to UI, which eliminates the need to cast weak B3s. Due to this, B4 no longer yields a Paradox, so it is often skipped as well. </p><p>These concepts allow the overall PPS of the non-standard gameplay to increase compared to the standard rotation. While accomplishing this, it exhausts much more resources than is needed in the Standard rotation and also often reduces the rotational time. As a result, the fire phase is usually very tight and requires prolonged periods of stillness, which make this playstyle much more prone to errors.</p><p><strong>From sims and calculations of non-standard when compared to pure standard (no AF1 F3P), we have estimated a gain of 0.7% to a bit higher than 2%.</strong> The 0.7% floor comes from AF1 F3P Standard’s gain, and the comparison is lowered by ~0.7% if we are comparing to that instead. There is no single exact number to the how much gain non-standard can bring, and is instead dependent on the fight as well as the player’s incorporation of effective lines. Furthermore, the benefits of non-standard are a matter of great diminishing returns. It is relatively easy to obtain, as an example, an 1% gain through non-standard optimizations. Obtaining the next 0.5% requires a drastic step up in effort and difficulty, with a further 0.5% being exponentially more difficult. </p><p>The bracketed letter and number below are an index to the <a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K57e7zFoCuLDLX2kbCAlRBrJO6LS42ifz7e5DQEPn8E>BLM lines comparison sheet</a>, where you can find the math behind everything as well as more lines that were not chosen to be discussed here. For example, [N0] refers to the Normal rotation tab, ID 0.</p><h2 id=base-rotation>Base Rotation</h2><h3 id=standard-rotation-n0>Standard rotation [N0]</h3><p><div class=md__image><img id="[143 320 310 140 493 296]" src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0jf9ym-WuKv4IDUO8-L3tMA4P0arFpHlG4r1-BbrSgiqzvZehFcTSwz4qNZuU4DGkjf8u_7pJ2niB1P1GY7ei-8Sxom3bFoDd17_H7P3mxm1JY8aJE7LzRjSXXu6UInHnTczaoXU onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div>A reminder of what is referred to as the Standard rotation.

However, we must also consider the previous line that yielded the F3P, as well as its potential to repeat itself. Consistently using F3P this way results in about a 0.9% damage increase (more details in the next section) of fire and ice spells over multiple lines. This is highly recommended to players first starting to optimize, as it is a relatively easy optimization for a decent DPS increase. Note that due to receiving the stacks of Astral Fire at the beginning of the GCD instead of the end, at lower SpS, there is no longer the option to fit four F4s between the F3 and AF Paradox, and any filler spells become exceedly tight if possible at all. This increases the execution difficulty of the standard line.</p><h2 id=higher-level-blm-concepts>Higher level BLM Concepts</h2><h3 id=mp-and-lucid-ticks>MP and Lucid ticks</h3><p>Our MP regens for 600 per tick out of combat and 200 per tick during combat, with each tick happening every three seconds. While in Umbral Ice, we gain an additional MP of 3000, 4500, and 6000 MP from the UI1, UI2, and UI3 bonuses respectively. In total, we can expect 3200, 4700, or 6200 MP per tick while in UI. On the other hand, Lucid ticks provide 550 MP per tick. In the overworld, each Lucid tick happens exactly halfway between two MP ticks. However, while in an instance, this timer will constantly drift, and it will become random when a Lucid tick occurs. </p><p>Both MP and Lucid ticks can be tracked via triggers. You can download a <a href=https://github.com/marconsou/mp-tick-bar>MP tick trigger here</a>, with other triggers available elsewhere. Having a tick trigger makes tracking MP ticks considerably easier and is recommended for anyone serious about high end BLM optimizations. In addition, some optimizations listed in later sections are only possible with MP tick triggers.</p><p><strong>Early and correct MP ticks</strong></p><p>Understanding how MP ticks interact with our rotation will become increasingly important as we dive deeper into non-standard lines. In many cases, if we get the right MP tick, often in the form of an early tick, we can conserve one filler resource. <strong>Such filler skips will prove to be crucial in reducing the cost of non-standard lines.</strong> For example, in the AF1 F3P Standard line above, if an MP tick happens right after we enter UI, we know that the next tick will happen sometime during or after the B4 cast, granting us full MP. With this, we can safely skip one filler. </p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[103 151 466 265 389 439]" src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YCkBro8qbPjFbIHmtexoQvatFGVbbdaalbDBtMhq-lkM4qfbPATrvnPoPSv3SAMBsNH0x0X_qctiLLCRF1CxCdXtCGYFo65oGbloYaNhEUfindXTDt3uLe1IMaF4rA1KgcooK04U onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><h3 id=the-blm-rotation-and-lines>The BLM rotation and lines</h3><p>A line is a sequence of casts with specific characteristics that ends after a fire phase. A rotation refers to a line or lines that can feasibly loop and repeat itself. This is why only the standard line is typically referred to as a rotation, while other lines are more strictly referred to as lines. Combinations of non-standard lines are collectively referred to as non-standard playstyle. </p><p>When calculating and comparing relative potencies of lines, only the fire and ice spells are considered and the potencies of Xeno and Thunder spells are excluded. <strong>Thus, any damage gains and losses listed in this document only refer to comparison with other fire and ice spells, and do not reflect the gain or loss of the whole rotation.</strong> Overall, fire and ice spells account for approximately 75% of our total damage, which means the gains and losses of non-standard lines in the overall rotation are only about 75% of what is listed here. In the AF1 F3P Standard line shown above, the ~0.9% increase would translate to about a 0.7% overall increase in damage. </p><h3 id=fight-and-blm-specific-strategies>Fight and BLM specific strategies </h3><p>All of the optimizations listed here require you to stand still as much as possible, and sometimes have control over mechanics’ resolution. Thus, it would be easier to execute these optimizations in a static environment with cooperative teammates. Conversely, The standard rotation gains more prevalence in pugs. Strategizing around fight mechanics and timelines to reduce movement and instant cast usage is a key part of BLM optimizations’ effectiveness and must not be ignored. </p><p>To get started, you can check the BLM raid guide (Coming soon. For now, check the Balance Discord’s BLM encounter channels). There are many more optimizations with strategies that can be done than what is written here. As a generic tip, for every instant spent on a mechanic, think about how to eliminate its need. And for every movement required, think about how it can either be eliminated or done effectively. Be proactive when creating your own alterations of strats to conserve resources. </p><h3 id=caster-tax>Caster tax </h3><p>Caster tax is on average an additional 0.1+2/FPS seconds to the listed cast time of a hard casted spell due to animation lock at the end of the spell. In this document, we will take 0.1s as the caster tax. While not unique to this job, BLM is the job affected the most by caster tax. This means a hard casted Fire IV is in fact 2.9 seconds and not the 2.8 seconds shown. Caster tax is mitigated with instant cast spells which have their animation lock while the GCD is inactive. </p><h3 id=strong-and-weak-spells>Strong and weak spells </h3><p>Not all BLM spells are equal; there is a large discrepancy in damage between the strong spells and weak ones.

Thus, instead of using a weak spell to swap elements, we look to use another tool: Transpose. When using Transpose to swap to Umbral Ice, typically we do not cast B3 as the purpose is to skip it. This means we lack the requirement to obtain the AF Paradox since we need three Umbral Ice stacks, which in turn also reduces B4’s effectiveness. This results in one less Paradox in the line as well as shorter fire and ice phases. In addition, due to a more limited AF phase to finish the maximum number of fire casts, Transpose lines have a higher execution requirement. </p><p>In most situations, Transpose to UI should be weaved in the first weave slot to allow the maximum amount of time for MP to regenerate. It should also be weaved after an instant, as clipping the Transpose will almost certainly invalidate any gain from a Transpose line and instead become a loss.</p><h3 id=4xf4-transpose-n33>4xF4 Transpose [N33]</h3><p>To cast 4xF4 and Despair, a minimum of 7200 MP is needed.

This has been made viable from F3P’s change to 30 seconds in Endwalker. However, as we are transitioning to AF with an instant, we can only fit in three F4s without high SpS. In addition, we must also consider the standard line with its probability that produced the F3P. With these considerations, this line in conjunction with standard yields a 0.55% gain, which is still less than AF1 F3P Standard. </p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[292 150 52 132 287 246]" src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/g7q8vGKJJSqsBzNu4On9kwIzvc99GXGXWnXXb8qxgypDKD-t_8I2hwzTCS5Rg38jCq30XgVdga68cmv3OLEO8DWz1vOIEdNbMvR-ytOOF0lbR877UqZJ7tJkIK-WtP8Vp2ye1s_V onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><p><strong>In practice, we want to take advantage of Double Transpose for an even stronger line, and would only use this line should an abysmally timed MP tick occur.

Examples of F3P producers include Standard and Double Paradox, and F3P consumers include all of the F3P Transpose lines previously discussed. Some lines neither produce nor consume a F3P, and some lines can produce as well as consume F3Ps. Another way to conceptualize this is to treat lines as F3P plus, F3P neutral, or F3P minus. Some of the strongest lines are F3P minus lines: these lines consume a F3P and must be paired with a F3P plus line in order to be looped. </p><p>This concept has several applications. For one, it is less ideal to end a phase or fight on a F3P producing line, as that F3P that could be used to enable a strong line is now wasted. In addition, this also plays a factor in line lengths. Imagine two F3P producing lines with the same PPS but have different lengths. The shorter line would then be stronger as it can enable F3P lines more frequently. Finally, when evaluating a line’s strength, its capability of producing a F3P must also be considered. </p><h3 id=evaluating-f3p-lines>Evaluating F3P lines</h3><p>When looking at F3P lines on their own, they seem to have ridiculously high PPS. While this is true, it doesn’t paint the whole picture of their strength. Keep in mind that F3P lines are F3P consumers. In order to obtain a F3P line, we must first go through a F3P plus line, and F3P lines should be evaluated alongside F3P producing lines. Within the F3P line, we can either rely on the natural proc rate, or use a Sharpcast. Whichever option we choose, there are additional costs associated with F3P lines that reduce their effectiveness. It is important to consider the management of these resources when evaluating if the gain in DPS is worth it. </p><h3 id=variation-as-a-result-of-f3p-lines>Variation as a result of F3P lines</h3><p>Unlike the singular GCD of a F3P, F3P lines are done across a sequence of casts. This means whether a F3P procs or not can vary the rotation by some 10-20 seconds. This is a huge variance when aiming to align with mechanics and phases, and manipulating this variance can be challenging. For this reason, it may be preferred to choose a line without such variation, such as Sharpcasting a Standard line, over relying on the proc chance of a F3P producing line such as Double Paradox. </p><h2 id=additional-double-transpose-lines>Additional Double Transpose Lines</h2><h3 id=3xf4-double-transpose-f3-n41>3xF4 Double Transpose F3 [N41]</h3><p><div class=md__image><img id="[219 253 198 446 444 17]" src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ubgArOIGTWk_TtWmy6JfEFmpqF-a_O3ME01y683C2IMh6IYaEN9l4u-lZofPAopUiCjh9P2av4r7dGTin-Cg2D6fSqY-TlF48P7kKTzz9xiIoYKUmP3dIRiRisFbz-SbOtfzDna5 onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><p>Same principle as 3xF4 Double Transpose Instant F3, except without the instant and with a slow casting F3.

An upgrade from N119 by eliminating the F1 with the UI Paradox. This is one of the strongest F3P lines but with a hefty resource cost.</p><h2 id=notes-on-thunder>Notes on Thunder</h2><p>The ideal Thunder refresh in non-standard is the same as it is in standard: as the dot falls off. However, compared to standard, non-standard lines are generally much shorter in length and have stricter filler applications. This causes Thunder usage to diverge during non-standard gameplay where we cannot always refresh Thunder when the dot is about to fall off. Every 30 seconds of overwritten dot with T3P is equal to replacing a spell with a 400 potency T3P. If a T3 is used instead of T3P, then this becomes a lot less than 400 potency. This results in a devaluation of lines if dot ticks are cut short, and it is also true for the standard rotation. </p><p>Generally during non-standard, you should aim to avoid cutting the dot short by more than 5-10 seconds with a proc, and avoid cutting the dot short at all with a hardcast. Sharpcast adds some degree of leniency with regards to cutting ticks short. In addition, dropping the dot for more than one tick should also be avoided. The exact gains and losses from Thunder use in non-standard is dependent on various factors. As a rule of thumb, the stronger the non-standard line, the more leniency you have with deviating from optimal Thunder usage. Sharpcast on Paradox or F1 is a gain if strong Double Transpose F3P lines are enabled when compared to using it on Thunder. </p><h2 id=notes-on-spell-speed>Notes on Spell Speed</h2><p>Unless specified, the lines in this document are tested at 1400 SpS, or 2.32 GCD. With a few exceptions which are also specified, all lines are doable at 2.32 GCD with the listed fillers without missing MP ticks. To perform the 4xF4 Despair after F3P with Triplecast, a hard minimum of 2.43 GCD is required, and a 2.37 GCD is required if only two stacks of Triple are used on F4s. See the Appendix section for more spell speed thresholds. More SpS should be added for leniency. Some lines might not be applicable at (much) higher spell speeds and additional fillers might be needed at extremely high spell speeds. The higher your spell speed, the less luck you will have with MP ticks. This principle also applies to Ley Lines. While LL can enable additional F4s in the fire phase, it also changes how MP ticks interact with fillers in UI. Thus, beware of MP ticks during UI when LL is active. Double Transpose lines also require an additional filler under LL as the faster GCD will be clipped by Transpose’s cooldown. </p><p>In addition to MP ticks considerations, much of Black Mage’s resources function on a fixed timer that are not affected by spell speed. Additional spell speed will not increase the number of available fillers, Swifts/Triples, and Sharpcasts available. Furthermore, a faster spell speed will often require extra Thunder ticks to be cut short. As a general rule of thumb, the faster the spell speed, the noticeably less available and less effective some lines, especially short Double Transpose lines, will become. </p><h3 id=standard-rotation-under-ley-lines>Standard rotation under Ley Lines</h3><p>At a SpS of 2.3 GCD or faster, obtaining two UI3 ticks during ice phase with standard under Ley Lines is no longer guaranteed. At SpS BiS, there is about a 10-15% chance of missing the second MP tick, and an additional filler may be needed. </p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[373 269 471 20 29 286]" src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/j1IuonNVYJG5qrSJLnM8r_qjO0H3UNGpdND_EyYI9ThphYP7WWlYkILVj-zNJzvXIYeLIM9lJeYegJxXPijM_Eyt_hPr-422U6QbfwdLwGwAFvEn1GG4iauPycyAjJCHSOYaP4-v onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><h2 id=comparing-fireice-lines>Comparing Fire/Ice Lines</h2><p><strong><a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K57e7zFoCuLDLX2kbCAlRBrJO6LS42ifz7e5DQEPn8E/>For calculations and details behind the math of everything in this document, see this sheet.</a></strong> When analyzing strengths and weaknesses of lines, there are numerous factors to be considered. </p><h3 id=pps>PPS</h3><p>The most straightforward factor. PPS has a direct effect on a line’s effectiveness. When comparing PPS, the percent of difference should be the metric over a raw number. When calculating PPS of lines, potencies of Thunder and Xeno are not included. As mentioned before, this creates a difference in the PPS and PPS comparisons of lines, versus the PPS of the overall rotation. </p><h3 id=resources-required>Resources required </h3><p>Another important factor is the amount of resources each line requires. Resources come in the form of instant casts spent, F3Ps used, Sharpcasts available, and Swift/Triples used. There is a correlation between the amount of resources a line requires and its potency. Finding the optimal rotation has thus become a balancing act of using less potent lines that conserve resources, versus stronger lines that expend resources. </p><p>A consistent resource expenditure when analyzing lines is essential. If more resources are spent, then a higher return should be expected. This is pivotal when looking at instant F3 lines, with Swift/Triple and F3P. It would be disingenuous to compare a line that has used Swiftcast to a line that does not use Swift. The effect of Swiftcast would skew the result in its favor.</p><p>Swift and Triple also have an unequal effect on each line’s PPS due to varying line lengths. The same reduction in cast time will increase a shorter line’s PPS more than it would on a longer line. As such, the PPS and relative potencies of lines with Swift and Triple should be adjusted to account for this effect. For this reason, a line with Swift might have a higher raw PPS but a lower relative PPS once Swift’s effect has been normalized. </p><p><strong>Likelihood of filler skips from correct MP ticks</strong></p><p>Every line has a certain probability of allowing a filler skip from obtaining the right MP ticks. It is possible to calculate precisely how likely it is to skip a filler in each line. Using less resources increases effectiveness and thus a high chance of skipping a filler also increases a line’s effectiveness. </p><h3 id=line-length>Line Length</h3><p>The length of each line is another crucial consideration for two reasons. Firstly, as discussed previously, one goal of utilizing different lines is to align with mechanics and phases. Finishing a full fire phase is always a priority. In addition, each line’s length also dictates their strength. Some lines may be very powerful, but expend a high amount of resources and only last a short amount of time. We are then forced to return to a relatively weaker line, such as Standard, for a larger portion of our rotation. Compare this to a similar line in terms of resources requirement that is slightly weaker, but at a longer length. This would mean we get to stay in this line for a prolonged period of time before needing to return to a weak line.</p><p><strong>Time Gained Equivalent</strong> </p><p>Time Gained Equivalent (TGE) is a more advanced metric of evaluating line strength. Each unit of TGE equates to gain in time as if we did the Standard rotation for that amount of time. For example, a TGE of 1.0 would mean the gain of the line is equal to one second of the Standard line. This number is given by the formula relativePPS * lineLength - lineLength, and normalizes the line lengths by treating its gain in PPS as a gain in time. This allows comparison of lines with varying lengths and PPS. The concept of TGE can be extended by multiplying TGE by PPS of the Standard line, which converts TGE into a potency equivalent: Potency Gained Equivalent or PGE. This is useful when conceptualizing a line’s overall return as a potency and has application in Thunder related comparisons. TGE and PGE should be treated as theoretical ideas for evaluating lines rather than a deterministic calculation. </p><h3 id=flexibility>Flexibility</h3><p>The extent of optimization is fundamentally limited by fight mechanics. In order to line up with mechs, some degree of flexibility may be required in the lines we choose. An easy way to determine a line’s flexibility is its number of available filler spots during its AF phase. For Standard, there are two available filler spots, one on each side of the Paradox refresh. The majority of non-standard lines offer no flexibility, which contributes to their difficulty in execution. </p><h2 id=choosing-fireice-lines>Choosing Fire/Ice Lines</h2><p>When choosing which line to use, there are a number of factors to consider. </p><h3 id=mechanics>Mechanics</h3><p>The most important and most straightforward consideration. If motion is required, then lines that require stillness are unavailable. This can also come in the form of needing to use an instant for weaving. This factor can sometimes favour non-standard lines, as many Double Transpose lines utilize multiple instant cast spells during UI, which are valuable as movement tools. </p><p>Example: during a phase with a high movement requirement, instead of using F3P for a Double Transpose line, it is instead used to prolong the fire phase to allow extra fillers for handling mechanics. </p><h3 id=pps-1>PPS</h3><p>Another straightforward consideration. We want to aim to choose lines that provide the highest overall potency over the same amount of time. </p><p>Example: during AoE, using 3xHF2 Transpose over 2xHF2 Transpose with Freeze for its higher PPS with the same amount of instant fillers. </p><h3 id=available-resources>Available resources</h3><p>The amount of resources also dictate which lines are available. Keeping track of instants, Swift/Triple, Sharpcast, and Fire and Thunder procs is key in deciding the optimal line. Be mindful of resources that may be needed to handle mechanics. </p><p>Example: using Double Transpose with instant F3 with an available T3P, two Xenos, and Swiftcast. </p><h3 id=phase-and-buff-alignment>Phase and buff alignment </h3><p>Although BLM’s damage is relatively consistent, small gains can be made by aligning properly with buff windows. In addition, lines should be chosen if their fire phase can be completed before the boss phases. </p><p>Example: choosing a shorter line before buff window arrives so that the start of the next fire phase aligns with buffs.</p><h3 id=thunder-refresh>Thunder refresh </h3><p>If choosing a line would result in a long period of dropped Thunder, it is likely better to choose a different line with a well timed Thunder refresh. </p><p>Example: entering a standard line to refresh T3 instead of cutting Thunder DoT ticks short for a non-standard line. </p><h3 id=mp-ticks>MP ticks</h3><p>Having a correct tick often means conserving instant resources. This may impact the chosen line as spending less resources returns a higher effectiveness. In more advanced cases where MP ticks are aimed to be accurately aligned, interaction between lines and tick alignment also become much more important. </p><p>Example: choosing a different line over 3xF4 Double Transpose due to its tighter tick timing when one filler is skipped.</p><p><strong>The decision of which line to enter is extremely situational as it is more dependent on mechanics, alignments, procs, and resources, rather than a simple potency comparison</strong></p><h1 id=advanced>Advanced</h1><p><strong>Certain section requires the <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsI2r4064VHJ8WuhItXB7ilbdjEJ26GphZSsjWiyDDU/>MP tick trigger.</a></strong> </p><h2 id=opener-sequence>Opener Sequence</h2><p>Earlier, we explored the possibility of combining non-standard lines into our opener for longer and stronger openers. With the ability to track MP ticks as well as being able to do the countdown, we have far more control over the beginning of each fight. We can eliminate unnecessary fillers during UI and create stronger openers. A prolonged opener phase also eliminates some variance and provides consistency to what we aim to do.</p><p><strong>Example opener sequence</strong></p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[443 384 301 116 294 186]" src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Flgm1Gql72Vuj1_Jq5jgStZp0DQv0l9XVHvQiyd8oR8SkjnmWSrNDeBcvCCHvwquH9dvMQ0njiRixVUpFKrtRLCLAc_v5Wi3p1ZwyeW7VMrV3d8Qj34mq0dtPLZrNvLgp6Txaa-V onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><p>Sharpcast at -18 seconds. 1:53 in length, 2.32 GCD.

The limitation to how long a dummy opener sequence can be planned comes from the variance in T3 and F3 procs.

It’s up to you to figure out what is possible and optimal.</p><p><strong>Example Endwalker P2S opener sequence</strong> </p><p><a href=https://i.imgur.com/MF4Dpar.png>https://i.imgur.com/MF4Dpar.png</a> </p><p><a href=https://xivanalysis.com/fflogs/G6PA4X8LQtKCaMhp/21/1>https://xivanalysis.com/fflogs/G6PA4X8LQtKCaMhp/21/1</a> </p><p>Up until the first frozen wave push. 3 minutes 5 seconds in length.</p><h3 id=sequence-branching>Sequence branching</h3><p>When planning an opener sequence, whether a proc occurs or not can alter our planned sequence. Similarly, randomness in mechanics may also force a deviance. To factor these random elements, we must either plan our sequence in such a way that the variance is eliminated, or plan multiple branches within the sequence should any deviances occur. </p><h2 id=utilizing-micro-downtime>Utilizing Micro Downtime</h2><p>A micro downtime refers to any <strong>actionable downtime where 2-3 Umbral Souls cannot be completed</strong>, or unactionable downtime where MP is still regenerated without dropping Enochian. Examples include short downtimes in E6S, Basic and Intermediate Relativities in E12S, and forced march mechanics. Commonly, a Sharp’d Paradox is used to prolong the fire phase, or the player enters ice phase with B4 and other fillers prior to the downtime. While full uptime is kept with these strategies, they miss the potential of a gain. <strong>Instead, micro and frozen downtimes should be viewed as an opportunity for MP to regenerate</strong>, thus enabling stronger lines. Micro downtime is not the same as long periods of actionable downtime. </p><p>We start by finishing the fire phase before the boss is untargetable. The simplest way to utilize micro downtimes is by Transposing after the Despair and let MP naturally regenerate instead of spending valuable filler instants. Ice Paradox can be used as the last hit and T3 can still be applied in these lines if needed. We can then Double Transpose into a variety of lines, using the MP we had received. </p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[358 328 459 278 48 210]" src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ztb2SwO3qoKujFmtYjvzc3cMH5WvaFaoi0x2yRbkvc4OLr12rq61sLRC_NBFVn_NuHcCNxt2tflibb618fN46nNwZ8N05VOkx7-_vvdKne1XK-yrc0Cy2AmCJVIOYHug9PiecVn1 onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><p>We can do better than this with Double Transpose Paradox lines.

Alternatively, Sharpcast can be used to ensure the proc. There are more variations of lines possible, depending on the MP and UH available and the exact scenario. Other Transpose lines can also be considered with this principle.</p><h2 id=advanced-blm-concepts>Advanced BLM Concepts</h2><h3 id=approaches-to-non-standard-playstyle>Approaches to non-standard playstyle </h3><p>There are two approaches to non-standard: spreadsheeting and improvising. In Shadowbringers, the length of a Thunder’s proc in relation to the length of the dot was a major contributor to deviations of non-standard sequences. With Thunder changes in Endwalker as well as the additional Sharpcast charge, Thunder refreshes are now highly predictable. By limiting F3P variations with Sharpcasts and having exact control over the occurrences of MP ticks, we can plan out and “spreadsheet” a sequence of casts up to the length of an entire fight. A predictable and exact sequence allows careful calculations to be made for enabling the optimal line with precise timings. Contrast this to a more reactionary “improvisation” playstyle (also known as freestyling), where prior planning plays a much smaller role and decisions are instead made in real time. Certain fights, mechanics, and lines may have many variations where planning is undesired and spontaneous decision making is more effective. Double Paradox is a prime example of a line that would benefit from a flexible sequence over a fixed one. In addition, any fight with a variable killtime phase cannot be precisely spreadsheeted due to uncertainty in MP tick occurrences and other factors. Examples of such fights include Ultimates and any fight with an adds phase. Both methods of non-standard have different merits and elements of difficulty, and players should aim to become familiar with both styles. </p><h3 id=shifting-of-early-thunder-refreshes>Shifting of early Thunder refreshes</h3><p>When consecutive Thunder refreshes have their ticks cut short, the sum of total ticks cut short should be examined over each individual refresh. If a refresh is cut short by 10 seconds and the following refresh is cut short by five seconds, the consideration is the total 15 seconds of shortened dot. In effect, this is the same as cutting one refresh short by 15 seconds and the other by 0 seconds. This principle allows for better Thunder alignment. For example, if a Thunder is refreshed under buffs, then it is better to let that Thunder run for a longer duration.</p><p>This principle has a critical application in refreshes dependent on natural proc rates. In the following sequence, the second and third Thunder refreshes have their dots cut short by five seconds each. The first Thunder is Sharped and the second Thunder is not. This results in a guaranteed proc for the second Thunder and natural proc rate for third. Since the second Thunder’s proc is certain and unchanged by the length of the DoT, it should be refreshed early to enable the maximum amount of ticks for the third Thunder and increase its chance of generating a proc.</p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[371 335 418 113 284 67]" src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XowwaFs4C1T6RVE5T_ZLZW-ZXdTYzWma2hMjKjO246cTS3rYoGFc6wdiJsyjOcTmzpP4rsgggEyVqh7lqdTz-M6vqgU-v8YEDw8WofLR9IA4SIZx3AkVCHuCq_vzUlGHs4c1MCSF onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><h3 id=buff-alignment>Buff alignment </h3><p>While BLM’s damage output is relatively consistent, non-standard provides us with the tools to better align with buff phases.

With the advent of Paradox in Endwalker and Sharpcast being 30 seconds, we have more instants for weaving with a more lenient oGCD usage requirement. If possible, it is preferred to weave elsewhere over fast F3 and B3. While it is a very small amount of time saved and is only worthy of consideration at the top end of optimization, over the course of a full uptime fight, the accumulated clip could mean the difference between ghosting the last GCD or not. </p><h3 id=optimizing-the-last-sharpcast>Optimizing the last Sharpcast </h3><p>Suppose the boss dies at t-0 second. Then ideally, the last Thunder refresh would have happened at t-30 seconds. This creates a problem: there is not enough time for an effective use for the Sharpcast that occurs between t-30 and t-0. For most players where a precise kill time is not guaranteed, using the Sharp to ensure a T3P is available for kill time variance likely has a higher importance. However, if the kill time is optimized with precise GCD planning, then using the last Sharpcast for a F3P line may result in a gain. For this purpose, ideally the F3P producing line is a shorter line, such as N116, due to the time constraint from Sharpcast’s cooldown to the kill. </p><p><strong>Double Transpose F3P Despair [N115.1]</strong></p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[465 3 4 110 41 13]" src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8wRkFinVBLB5QQ5xtchl-ChjmHz-qP2P0adF-vYXZsWSiprNDZ2oho4o6tNTEDyA2zgbThV_Bl1vA7FBvQf2NFb8OyDr9boq448j8Zt1iDG_20y6eO3jy4sJJB4mqGNeSfhqBDIf onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><p>This must be a Double Transpose to be a gain.

Sharpcast used at ~23 seconds prepull.</p><h2 id=tracking-filler-skips-with-triggers>Tracking Filler Skips with Triggers</h2><p>Earlier, we mentioned UI fillers can be skipped if an early tick happens. Extending on this concept, based on when the next MP tick will happen in relation to our rotation, we can calculate precisely whether we can skip a filler or not. To do this, we need a point of reference in our rotation. This point of reference of the ticker can be “when B3 starts casting” or “when the first instant is cast”, etc. We can use these calculations and calculate the probability of a filler skip in each line. An example can be seen in this <a href=https://github.com/marconsou/mp-tick-bar>MP tick tracker</a>, with the start of F3’s cast marked on the bar while still yielding the required MP tick.</p><p>Cast confirmation, a key mechanic of the game, does not happen at the end of the cast, but rather ~0.5 seconds before the cast is done. This is the same as the slidecast window. This means B3 and F3 will transition to the opposite element not at the end of their casts, but about 0.5 seconds before. </p><p>Tracking MP ticks is highly SpS and ping dependent. You should do calculations for your own set and test their consistency. <strong>The key takeaway of this section is that it is possible to spontaneously know precisely whether or not a filler skip is possible.</strong></p><h3 id=likelihood-of-filler-skip-in-each-line>Likelihood of filler skip in each line</h3><p>Extending on the principle of tracking filler skips, we can also calculate how likely it is for the right MP ticks to occur in each line and allow potential filler skips. In the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K57e7zFoCuLDLX2kbCAlRBrJO6LS42ifz7e5DQEPn8E/edit?usp=sharing">lines comparison sheet</a>, the probabilities of filler skips in some common lines are listed. This is yet another element to determining a line’s strength, as a higher chance of skipping a filler means less resource is required to execute the line. </p><h2 id=additional-niche-lines>Additional Niche Lines</h2><h3 id=3xf4-double-transpose-instant-f3-with-clipped-triple-i27>3xF4 Double Transpose Instant F3 with Clipped Triple [I27]</h3><p><div class=md__image><img id="[25 381 29 345 222 16]" src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XQmdDgATJDVJyej0Myh6urBycmPujWcCiNYnrMebXCyvDI72RB4wqjZwP_l-lYS0G9DJAqHCiiYMBqH5JU0RYS0mln6_Cg2OF64BHQx7xutLUm0dQDzJWIo73hYRDZe7_1svzNvc onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><p>In order to reduce the resource requirement of the strong 3xF4 Double Transpose line, we can create an instant by forcefully clipping Triplecast before Despair.

I did not anticipate being this deeply involved with Black Mage theorycrafting. However, as I dug through the different forms of rotations, I became intrigued with them and gradually discovered more things about them and about Black Mage. There is a sort of mathematical beauty in seeing an optimal BLM rotation with upgraded lines and perfect alignments of procs, ticks, and mechanics. The base or standard BLM rotation is extremely easy, but evidently, this is only the surface. Beneath the surface lies a hidden but vast arsenal of optimizations to increase BLM’s damage. Mastering the usage of this arsenal takes incredible skill, and it’s a great contrast to the simplistic nature of the base rotation. In an age where job complexity is reducing across the board, I am proud that Black Mage still has much to offer, and I am excited to see what players do to push its limits.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="responsive-container pt-8 lg:pt-0"><div class="tabbed md:pt-8"><input type=radio id=tab-Authors name=css-tabs checked>
