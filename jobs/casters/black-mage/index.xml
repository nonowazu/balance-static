This document aims to provide a comprehensive guide on advanced non-standard playstyle (also known as the AI rotation). There is the assumption you know all of the basics of BLM, including abbreviations and fundamentals.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/faq/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 20:24:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/faq/</guid><description>Q: What is Umbral Soul used for? A: Purely a downtime tool, a better version of Transpose. Lets you build back up to Umbral Ice III + Three Umbral Hearts during downtime, so you can Thunder III -&amp;gt; Fire III when you can hit something again. If you end a fight in Astral Fire, Transpose into UI so you can use Umbral Soul. Do not use Umbral Soul during uptime.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 20:24:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</guid><description>Openers Openers should put abilities on cooldown, fit strong spells within buff windows, and minimize clipping. All openers assume there is a pull countdown and the boss is pulled at zero. If your group pulls earlier, adjust them as necessary. Use the highest tier Tincture / Infusion / Potion of Intelligence available.
With all openers being very close in estimated output over the course of the entire encounter, it is instead recommended to choose your opener based on your current spell speed, with consideration towards potential fight-specific requirements.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 20:23:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</guid><description>Actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Blizzard 1 Spell 400 2.5s 2.5s Deals ice damage with a potency of 180.

Job Overview Black Mage is a caster specializing in high, steady personal damage in place of providing party buffs. The job maintains a cyclical flow of expending MP via long, powerful casts in Astral Fire then swapping to refresh MP in Umbral Ice. While the rotation itself is somewhat simple, utilizing its movement tools and the flexibility built into its rotation to their fullest is key to maintaining uptime and maximizing damage as a Black Mage.</description></item></channel></rss>
