The core foundation of Summoner has changed significantly, most notably with the complete removal of damage over time abilities (dots) and the newly added primal arcanum system (gems). The basic flow and idea of Summoner’s rotation can be simplified as follows:
Use Searing Light in alignment with party raid buffs Summon Bahamut and use all abilities to refresh your primal gems Go through three primal phases Summon Phoenix and use all abilities to refresh your primal gems Go through three primal phases Repeat Within that framework, there is additional nuance such as optimizing damage into raid buffs, moving certain spells around based on movement requirements, and making effective use of Summoner’s various utility tools.</description></item><item><title>Summoner Job Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 08:00:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Summoner Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 07:54:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Due to the nature of the SMN job changes, advanced content is included in the Basic Guide.

Since the 6.1 changes, we can now use Searing Light in Bahamut, and choose to do so after the Bahamut GCD to avoid using a &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; GCD in our buff. You can choose to omit the precast Ruin III and use Bahamut at 0s as well. This may be an optimization strategy for particular fight timelines or encounters where the gained one second on cycle progression may matter.</description></item><item><title>Summoner FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/faq/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 05:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/faq/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Summoner Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 03:04:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction Welcome! This page is written to assist you throughout your leveling journey and provide insight on how the Summoner job will evolve from level one to level 80. Summoner may appear as a bit of a “unique” job with a lot of moving parts and multiple avenues of attacking enemies. Throughout this leveling guide, we will provide you with a basic fundamental understanding of each spell that you will unlock, as well as provide some quick rotation priorities and visualization examples.</description></item><item><title>Summoner Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 02:58:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/skills-overview/</guid><description>Actions Icon Action Level Type Casting Recast Description Summon Carbuncle 2 Spell 1.5s 2.5s Summons Carbuncle to your side.

SpS to 2.46-2.48 &amp;gt; Crit &amp;gt; Det &amp;gt;= DH &amp;gt; More SpS
There is an alternative way to play the job that focuses on maximizing SpS and minimizing Crit instead, which would use this priority:
SpS &amp;gt; Det &amp;gt;= DH &amp;gt; Crit
In general, the Crit set appears better for most situations. Spell speed as a stat excels when it can be fine-tuned around a fight’s timeline, but you can choose to use the SpS set blindly if you wish.</description></item></channel></rss>
