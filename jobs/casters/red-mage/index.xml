Red Mage is somewhat flexible with its openers: Often, prioritizing one thing comes at the expense of another (i.e. buff damage potency vs Fleche/Contre Sixte usage vs movement flexibility for mechanics), and what is actually optimal or most practical will depend on encounter design. If further discoveries are made or job changes occur, these openers will be adjusted for future versions of the guide, and readers can also expect fight-specific Savage and/or Ultimate openers to be made for encounters with more unique timelines.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 03:34:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/basic-guide/</guid><description>Red Mage Level 100 Guide for 7.x (Preliminary) Currently, this guide is in a preliminary state, which aims to concisely cover a basic overview of the Red Mage changes brought with Dawntrail along with an introduction to new rotation and opener concepts.
