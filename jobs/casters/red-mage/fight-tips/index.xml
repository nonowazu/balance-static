Therefore, you should use this guide for a general idea of how to manage each phase, but keep in mind this may not always work for you, and you should aim to find a timeline that works for you during progression.</description></item><item><title>The Omega Protocol (Ultimate) Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/the-omega-protocol-ultimate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 04:00:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/the-omega-protocol-ultimate/</guid><description>The Omega Protocol (Ultimate) RDM Guide This raid features a unique mix of multiple tight DPS checks, movement-intensive mechanics requiring real-time adjustment, and flexible optimization potential. That said, with some planning and smart resource management, Red Mage is able to perform well in this raid and bring a lot of value to a party.
There are six phases in this raid. Generally, every phase has a DPS check that requires some basic optimization, but the difficulty of Phase 2 and Phase 3 DPS checks tend to depend on party composition and buff timings, with Phase 2 benefitting cleave-heavy compositions and Phase 3 benefitting full uptime 2-minute burst compositions.</description></item><item><title>Abyssos</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/abyssos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 18:05:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/abyssos/</guid><description>For information on Addle and Magick Barrier usage, see https://bit.ly/3AHEMxZ
P5S Potion Usage Due to the fight being ten minutes long, using potion off cooldown for progression is recommended as that will get you three potions before enrage. However, it is fairly common for even undergeared parties to kill the boss before or around nine minutes, with kill times going as fast as near seven minutes now.
With this in mind, it is usually better to use your first potion at two minutes with a triple combo.</description></item><item><title>Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate) Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/dragonsongs-reprise-ultimate-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 03:41:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/dragonsongs-reprise-ultimate-guide/</guid><description>Introduction In this raid, only three phases in particular have what most would consider to be tight DPS checks (Nidhogg, Eyes, Dragon King Thordan), and one with a moderate one (Double Dragons). The Double Dragons phase DPS check is low in terms of boss HP relative to enrage timer, but in practice can feel high for people who struggle to keep uptime amid its mechanics.
Other phases, however, are much more lenient with minimal uptime considerations.</description></item><item><title>The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate) Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/the-unending-coil-of-bahamut-ultimate-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 01:09:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/the-unending-coil-of-bahamut-ultimate-guide/</guid><description>General Fight Tips Manafication Manafication’s damage buff and 110 second cooldown is granted by a trait at Lv.74 meaning that in Lv.70 content it functions the same way it did in Stormblood: with no damage buff and a 120s cooldown. As a result of there being no damage buff it should be used slightly differently than in level 80 and 90 content.
While you should still aim to finish phases with as much Black and White mana as possible, in the scenario that your mana is at 50 | 50 or below, you can use Manafication during downtime during or between phases to get it on cooldown faster.</description></item><item><title>Asphodelos Raid Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/asphodelos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 19:24:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/asphodelos/</guid><description>Red Mage Asphodelos Encounter Advice For information on Addle and Magick Barrier usage, see https://bit.ly/3AHEMxZ
P1S Intemperance Embolden should be used on cooldown, with the two-minute and six-minute buff windows occurring during Intemperance.
For the first Intemperance, as there is a delay between the Intemperance cast and the first set of tiles exploding, you can stand in the center of the arena to cast Embolden before moving out to your tile.</description></item></channel></rss>
